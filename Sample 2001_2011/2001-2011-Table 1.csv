We operate an e-financial marketplace where buyers and sellers worldwide can trade securities directly and anonymously with each other, gain price improvement for their trades and lower their overall trading costs. Through our electronic platforms, our customers also can access 40 securities markets throughout the world, including Nasdaq, the NYSE and stock exchanges in Frankfurt, Hong Kong, London, Paris, Sydney, Tokyo, Toronto and Zurich. We also provide our customers with access to research generated by us and by third parties, as well as various informational and decision-making tools. Our customers consist of institutional investors, such as mutual funds, pension funds, insurance companies and hedge funds, as well as broker-dealers. Our revenues consist primarily of transaction fees generated by our securities brokerage and related services. In 2000, we had revenues of $1.4 billion and earned net income of $148.2 million and in the first three months of 2001, we had revenues of $430.7 million and earned net income of $50.1 million. Until recently, our e-financial marketplace has centered almost exclusively on serving the needs of institutional investors and broker-dealers in the global markets for equity securities. In the United States, our customers include institutional investors that, as of December 31, 2000, accounted for approximately 98% of the total $10.7 trillion of equity assets under management of the 500 largest investment management firms identified in Nelson's Directory of Investment Managers 2000, as well as more than 700 broker-dealers. We have expanded our operations to Europe and Asia, where we had nearly 1,200 customers as of December 31, 2000, and are continuing to grow. During 2000, our customers used our systems to execute nearly 87.6 million transactions globally, of which 82.4 million transactions were in U.S. equity securities. Those U.S. transactions represented approximately 57.4 billion shares of Nasdaq-quoted stocks and 9.3 billion shares of NYSE-listed stocks. More than 80% of our customers' transactions in U.S. equity securities using our electronic trading systems were executed within our internal liquidity pool. In addition to execution of their equity securities transactions on a global basis, we offer our customers services that enhance our customers' abilities to achieve their trading objectives, including 24-hour trading, crossing services, block trading and portfolio trading, as well as global clearing and settlement of trades. In the Spring of 2000, we introduced our global electronic platform for trading fixed income securities. As of December 31, 2000, we provided brokerage and execution services to approximately 100 banks and broker-dealers with respect to approximately 800 separate issues of U.S. government, Euro- denominated government and German mortgage (Pfandbriefe) securities. We are expanding the scope of our fixed income securities activities further to reach a broader base of customers and include additional categories of fixed income securities. We have also established a wholesale business targeted at other broker-dealers and service providers. Our principal wholesale offerings currently consist of correspondent clearing and a platform for delivery to individual investors of the types of trading benefits we provide to our existing customer base of institutional and broker-dealer customers. We have begun providing discrete elements of the execution and clearing infrastructure on a wholesale basis primarily to broker-dealers. We plan to expand the range of our wholesale services, in particular to services designed for individual investors, and broaden our wholesale customer base to include other financial service providers, such as banks and mutual funds, and non-traditional service providers, such as companies that want to provide employee stock trading programs. We have built our business on a model that incorporates the following four core values: - INDEPENDENCE AND NEUTRALITY -- As an agency broker, we do not trade securities for our own account or maintain inventories of securities for sale. As a result, unlike exchange specialists, market makers and other market participants that trade for their own account, we have no interest in or in maintaining the trading spread (the difference between the price offered by a buyer and that asked by a seller) in the Nasdaq market or on an exchange. We also do not pay broker-dealers or other market participants to direct orders to us (referred to as payments for order flow). We avoid conflicts with our customers that interfere with their obtaining better pricing for their trades. - ANONYMITY -- Our systems do not require the identity of the ultimate buyer or seller to be disclosed to the counterparty or other market participants at any point in the trading process. We believe that anonymous trading can reduce the potential market impact of large transactions and transactions by certain investors whose trading activity, if known, may be more likely to influence other market activity, and may contribute to improved pricing for our customers. - EQUAL AND DIRECT ACCESS -- We provide all of our customers, without regard to their size or volume of trading, with equal and direct access to markets. Direct market access can increase the speed at which trades are executed and level the playing field among market participants. This enhanced market access also allows our customers to have available real-time information on the demand for and supply of one or more securities, a concept commonly referred to as transparency. - CUSTOMER EMPOWERMENT -- We use and develop technology to empower our customers to achieve their trading objectives. Our trading services and tools give our customers flexibility in choosing their level of direct participation in carrying out their trades. As a result of these core values, we believe that we provide our customers with valuable benefits that help them reach their trading objectives at reduced costs and with greater speed and efficiency. To expand the scope of our e-financial marketplace, we have made a number of strategic investments in companies with operations or technology that we believe will enable investors and issuers to better achieve their trading and capital-raising objectives. During the past two years, we have acquired beneficial ownership interests in: - 7.5% of TP Group LDC, a consortium that is the majority shareholder of TRADEPOINT FINANCIAL NETWORKS PLC, a U.K.-based electronic equities exchange; - 7.8% of W.R. HAMBRECHT + CO., INC., a U.S.-based investment banking firm that enables issuers to conduct auction-based securities offerings via the Internet; - 11.1% of the voting interest of ARCHIPELAGO, LLC, an electronic communications network that has applied for registration as a U.S. stock exchange; - 12.6% of VENCAST, INC., a U.S.-based company that offers opportunities for capital raising by, and investing in equity securities of, private companies via the Internet; and - 25.0% of TRADEWARE S.A., a European-based provider of integrated order routing solutions to broker-dealers in Europe. Over the years, we have also acquired a number of other companies. In October 1999, we acquired Montag Popper & Partner GmbH, a German fixed income voice broker. In February 2000, we acquired Lynch, Jones & Ryan, a leading provider of specialized brokerage, research and commission recapture services to pension plan sponsors and managers. We were founded in 1969 and, although continuously headquartered in New York since then, have been a wholly owned subsidiary of Reuters Group PLC since May 1987. We opened a London office in 1988 and have since added offices in Frankfurt, Hong Kong, Paris, Sydney, Tokyo, Toronto and Zurich. ",Broker,Electronics trading,,

System-on-chip refers to an integrated circuit that includes computing, memory and communications components that previously had been available only on separate chips. Our customers can gain a competitive advantage by using our products and services in advance of manufacture to design and verify integrated circuits that will perform as intended, taking into account the complex effects of deep-submicron semiconductor physics. This competitive advantage manifests itself in our customers' ability to deliver greater functionality in smaller and faster chips for networking, computing and wireless products. Customers successfully using our products include chip and system vendors such as AMD, ATI Technologies, Cadence Design Systems, Conexant Systems, Inc., Infineon, Intel Corporation, LSI Logic, Matrox Graphics, Philips Semiconductors, Silicon Graphics, Inc., Sony Corporation, STMicroelectronics, Sun Microsystems, Texas Instruments Incorporated, Toshiba and Vitesse Semiconductor. Each of these customers accounted for over $1,000,000 in revenue during the last ten quarters. Semiconductor, consumer electronics and other technology product manufacturers depend on their ability to launch products successfully and cost effectively within narrow market windows. First-mover advantage when introducing new products can be vital to capturing dominant market share for a given product segment, making the efficiency of design and manufacturing processes critical to competitive positioning. Delays caused by unanticipated design flaws can force product launch postponement or cancellation, resulting in the failure of products, divisions and even companies. At the same time, demand for portable, power-efficient and high-performance electronic products, such as cell phones, has driven chip manufacturers to design complex system-on-chip with small feature sizes reaching 0.18 micron and below, referred to as deep submicron. Feature size relates to the size of an integrated circuit's components and is measured in microns, or millionths of a meter. These system-on-chip integrate digital components, such as microprocessors and memory, together with analog components, such as radio- frequency receivers and analog-to-digital converters, into a single chip. According to the Integrated Circuit Engineering Corporation report (ICE -- 2000), the worldwide market for system-on-chip and application-specific integrated circuits is expected to grow from $23 billion in 1999 to $64 billion in 2004. Of this total market in North America, Dataquest estimates that the percentage of chips manufactured at or below 0.18 micron will grow from less than 10% of all chips manufactured in 1999 to over 85% of all chips manufactured in 2004. Using smaller feature sizes allows increased design functionality on a single chip but results in numerous constraints imposed by semiconductor physics. These constraints often exceed the capabilities of traditional design software and can result in expensive design and manufacturing iterations. In addition, designers are sometimes unable to diagnose and address design flaws that cause their chips to fail. The Collett International Research, Inc. 1999 and 2000 surveys report that, over each of the last two years, approximately one-half of the chips released to manufacture in North America required more than one manufacturing iteration prior to production ramp-up. Our system-on-chip verification software and services are designed to provide comprehensive, high-speed verification that an integrated circuit will perform as intended, taking into account the complex effects of deep submicron semiconductor physics. Our design foundry services provide design implementation to help our customers facilitate first-to-market delivery of system-on-chip designs. Using our products and services, our customers can eliminate manufacturing iterations by avoiding potential design flaws early in the design cycle. Eliminating iterations provides our customers with both significant savings in manufacturing costs and reduced time-to-market. The benefits we provide are the result of our expertise in chip design, computer science algorithms and software engineering, and include: - Advancing deep submicron integrated circuit design and manufacture: Our full- chip analysis capabilities are designed to enable electrical correctness throughout the design process. Integrated circuits with deep submicron feature sizes, or geometries, have electrical requirements, including power integrity, timing integrity, signal integrity and reliability that must be satisfied for a deep submicron chip to function as intended. Our products are designed to facilitate DSM closure early in the design process. DSM closure is the point in the deep submicron integrated chip design cycle where these electrical requirements are met. Although our products may be used to design chips with any feature size, at 0.18 micron and below design complexity reaches a point where our customers find the use of our products to be vital. - Accelerating product time-to-market: Our software and services accelerate time-to-market by helping designers deliver integrated circuits that function as intended, with fewer costly design and manufacturing iterations. - Delivering lower cost per chip: Our products increase design process efficiency, resulting in lower production costs, increased chip reliability and reduced end-product maintenance costs. Our customers use our products to design integrated circuits such as microprocessors, application-specific integrated circuits, digital signal processors and high-end graphics processors for many equipment markets including computers, networking, wireless and communications. In addition, we have developed strategic relationships with semiconductor manufacturers and software vendors in our customers' supply chain to integrate our software and services throughout our customers' design-through-production cycle. For example, we work with semiconductor manufacturers, or foundries, to measure the accuracy of our products and to obtain access to the most advanced semiconductor processes. These foundries include Chartered Semiconductor Manufacturing, IBM, NEC, Toshiba, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing and United Microelectronics. Many of these foundries have recommended the use of our products to their customers to help ensure high-quality results from manufacturing. We also participate in software integration programs with Cadence Design Systems, Mentor Graphics and Synopsys.

We license properties from a wide variety of sources including entertainment and media companies and we publish software based on their motion picture, sports and television properties. We currently publish software for many of the most popular interactive entertainment hardware platforms, such as the PlayStation manufactured by Sony Computer Entertainment, Nintendo 64 and Nintendo's Game Boy Color and Game Boy Advance, as well as for portable handheld devices manufactured by Palm and Handspring and for personal computers. We are developing and plan to publish software for next generation hardware platforms such as the PlayStation 2 manufactured by Sony Computer Entertainment, NINTENDO GAMECUBE and Microsoft's Xbox, as well as for other portable handheld devices. According to Euromonitor, a research group and statistical source, worldwide sales of consoles, console games and games for personal computers grew from $17.0 billion in 1996 to $26.9 billion in 2000. Forrester, a research group and statistical source, predicts that in the United States alone, interactive entertainment console manufacturers and software publishers will generate $29.4 billion in revenues in 2005. Of that $29.4 billion, Forrester estimates that $12.8 billion will be generated by sales of console game software alone. For additional information regarding these statistical sources. We believe that our ability to license popular properties, develop content with internal and third-party developers and distribute titles through our broad distribution channels provides us with significant competitive advantages. The key elements of our business approach are: + Development and promotion of titles based on properties with existing brand recognition. We believe that by developing interactive entertainment software titles based on popular properties and existing brands that appeal to specific segments of the interactive entertainment industry, we enhance consumer acceptance and product life cycles. We are developing titles in the following categories: - Adventure. We target game players ages 10 and under with titles based on licensed properties such as the popular television cartoons POWERPUFF GIRLS and DEXTER'S LABORATORY distributed by AOL Time Warner's Cartoon Network; - Sports. We target game players ages nine to 14, as well as the casual sports fan, with sports-based titles based on licensed properties of AOL Time Warner's Sports Illustrated for Kids; and - Action. We target the mass market with titles based on the licensed content originated by film production companies such as Spyglass Entertainment Group and Franchise Films. + Management experience. Our executive management team has substantial domestic and international experience in the interactive entertainment software industry. Key members of our management team have been founders and executives of other interactive entertainment software companies and in their current and past service have successfully identified and secured licenses for popular properties, established relationships with key third-party product developers and successfully negotiated distribution arrangements with multiple retail channels. Our team has developed strong working relationships with hardware platform manufacturers, which we believe provide substantial benefits in managing the product approval and development process. We believe our executive management team has the necessary experience to capitalize on opportunities afforded by the industry transition to next generation hardware platforms. + Strategic management of product development. We maintain a balanced mix of internal and external production efforts. We have an experienced in-house development staff and an internal product development studio where we develop titles. We have also established relationships with third-party interactive entertainment software developers with proven track records of developing successful titles. + Broad distribution channels. Our sales and marketing efforts are designed to broaden product distribution and increase the penetration of our products in domestic and international markets. We further seek to leverage and expand our channels of distribution in order to reach a larger number of consumers in the retail, direct and online markets, both domestically and internationally. We sell our interactive entertainment software to mass merchandisers such as Toys ""R"" Us, Target, Kmart, Wal-Mart and Best Buy, specialty chains such as Babbages, Etc. and Electronics Boutique and independent distributors. + Hardware platform flexibility. While we have the technical ability to develop products for all current hardware platforms, our development efforts focus on specific hardware platforms for specific demographics. In addition, we leverage our more popular titles across multiple hardware platforms that have sufficient installed bases and appropriate demographics for development to be successful. We believe this approach reduces both our reliance on any one hardware platform and the risks associated with product development.

Consumer video rentals and purchases comprised the largest portion of in-home filmed entertainment, representing $23 billion, or 73% of the market in 2001, according to Adams Media Research. The home video segment of the in-home filmed entertainment market is undergoing a rapid technology transition away from VHS to DVD. The DVD player is the fastest selling consumer electronics device in history, according to DVD Entertainment Group. In September 2001, standalone set-top DVD player shipments outpaced VCR shipments for the first time in history, and this trend continued throughout the remainder of 2001. At the end of 2001, approximately 25 million U.S. households had a standalone set-top DVD player, representing an increase of 97% in 2001. Adams Media Research estimates that the number of U.S. households with a DVD player will grow to 67 million in 2006, representing approximately 60% of U.S. television households in 2006. Our subscription service has grown rapidly since its launch in September 1999. We believe our growth has been driven primarily by our unrivalled selection, consistently high levels of customer satisfaction, rapid customer adoption of DVD players and our increasingly effective marketing strategy. We primarily use pay-for-performance marketing programs and free trial offers to acquire new subscribers. In the San Francisco Bay area, where the U.S. Postal Service can make one- or two-day deliveries from our San Jose distribution center, approximately 2.8% of all households subscribe to Netflix.

Our merchandise offerings include bed-and-bath goods, kitchenware, watches, jewelry, electronics, sporting goods and designer accessories. We offer our customers an opportunity to shop for bargains conveniently, while offering our suppliers an alternative inventory liquidation distribution channel. We typically offer approximately 4,000 products in 13 categories on our Websites, www.overstock.com and www.overstockb2b.com. We continually add new, limited inventory products to our Websites in order to create an atmosphere that encourages customers to visit frequently and purchase products before our inventory sells out. The traditional liquidation market for closeout merchandise has high information asymmetries among buyers and sellers that permit liquidation brokers to profit from market inefficiencies and, we believe, to generate some of the highest returns on capital in the retail industry. Overstock utilizes the Internet to reduce these asymmetries and inefficiencies. Overstock's business platform has four components. We have a ""direct"" business, in which we buy and take possession of excess inventory for resale. We also have our ""partner"" business, in which we receive a commission for selling other parties' excess inventory on our Websites. While we call this our ""partner"" business, these arrangements are not contractually binding and often change. For both our direct and partner models we have a consumer and a business-to-business (""B2B"") sales channel. Therefore, our business consists of four combinations of these components: direct consumer, direct B2B, partner consumer and partner B2B. We believe our business offers liquidation advantages for our manufacturers and shopping advantages for our customers, as listed below: Advantages for Manufacturers Advantages for Customers • Limited sales channel conflict • Discount prices • Single point of distribution • High quality and broad selection • Improved control of distribution • Convenient access • Improved transaction experience • Dedicated customer service Our objective is to leverage the Internet to become the dominant closeout solution for holders of brand-name merchandise, allowing them to dispose of that excess merchandise discretely and with high recovery values. We are pursuing this objective through the following key strategies: • Establish strong relationships with manufacturers; • Optimize inventory management through the use of technology; • Optimize marketing initiatives through the use of technology; • Maintain low customer acquisition costs; • Aggressively grow our B2B business; and • Deliver superior customer service. Our products are organized into 13 different departments. As of December 31, 2001 these were: Bed, Bath & Linens Home & Garden Décor Books, Movies & Music Housewares & Appliances Computer & Home Office Jewelry & Watches Electronics & Cameras Luggage & Business Fashion & Accessories Sports Gear Gifts & Gadgets Toys & Dolls Handmade Designs/Worldstock Each of these departments has multiple categories and subcategories that further organize the products offered within that department. When customers place orders on our Websites, orders are fulfilled either directly from our Salt Lake City, Utah warehouse or from one of our partners. We monitor both sources for accurate order fulfillment and timely shipment. We generally charge $3.95 for basic ground shipping, but customers can also choose from various expedited shipping services at their expense. Historically, we have not focused our marketing efforts on national print and media campaigns. Instead, we have focused primarily on online campaigns that we believe are the most cost-effective means to direct visitors to our Websites. We have also recently established a B2B sales force to grow this part of our business aggressively. We have a limited operating history, a history of significant losses and we expect to encounter risks and uncertainties frequently faced by early stage companies in rapidly evolving markets. The online liquidation services market is new, rapidly evolving, intensely competitive and has relatively low barriers to entry, as new competitors can launch new Websites at relatively low cost. We believe that competition in the online liquidation market is based predominantly on price, product quality and selection, shopping convenience, customer service, and brand recognition, all of which are difficult to achieve and maintain.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2001, the dollar value of payments made through PayPal to business accounts, which we refer to as Gross Merchant Sales or GMS, totaled $2.0 billion, or 87.5% of our total payment volume of $2.3 billion for the same period. Our GMS consists mainly of payments to small businesses. Currently, the majority of these payments relate to sales of goods and services through online auctions. As of September 30, 2001, we had 10.6 million total accounts, including 2.1 million business accounts and 8.5 million personal accounts. For the nine months ended September 30, 2001, 5.3 million of these accounts sent or received a payment that resulted in a fee. Our customers choose either PayPal business accounts or PayPal personal accounts. Business accounts pay us transaction fees on all payments they receive and enjoy a variety of additional features. These features include the ability to receive credit card-funded payments, the opportunity to apply for the PayPal ATM/debit card, listing in our PayPal Shops directory and use of our Web Accept feature to accept payments directly from their websites. Personal accounts may receive free payments funded from bank account transfers or existing PayPal balances and may send payments without any cost to them. Personal accounts can upgrade to business accounts at any time. During the nine months ended September 30, 2001, 622,000 customers upgraded from personal to business accounts. We earn revenues primarily from transaction fees on GMS, as well as from international funding and withdrawal fees and from fees on our ATM/debit card. For the three months ended September 30, 2001: • We generated revenues of $30.2 million. Of this amount, GMS fees comprised 82.8%, and we derived 15.1% of our revenues from non-U.S. customers; • Our transaction and other fees equaled $29.2 million, or 3.2% of our total payment volume of $924.6 million, compared to our transaction processing expenses of $12.4 million, or 1.3% of total payment volume; and • Our net loss totaled $32.4 million. Our net loss amounted to $1.2 million, excluding non-cash expenses of $31.2 million related to amortization of intangibles and stock-based compensation. For the nine months ended September 30, 2001: • We generated revenues of $64.4 million. Of this amount, GMS fees comprised 82.4%, and we derived 13.5% of our revenues from non-U.S. customers; • Our transaction and other fees equaled $61.4 million, or 2.7% of our total payment volume of $2.3 billion, compared to our transaction processing expenses of $31.9 million, or 1.4% of total payment volume; and • Our net loss totaled $89.3 million. Our net loss amounted to $19.1 million, excluding non-cash expenses of $70.2 million related to amortization of intangibles and stock-based compensation. The small business market presents us with a potentially significant opportunity. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, approximately 22.6 million small businesses in the U.S., those with less than $1.0 million in annual receipts, generate an aggregate of $1.6 trillion in annual sales. In addition, according to The Nilson Report, only 3.1 million merchants in the U.S. currently accept credit cards, leaving a large number of sellers unable to accept traditional electronic payments. By enhancing the existing payment infrastructure, the PayPal product serves the need of these sellers for a secure, convenient and cost-effective online payment system. To send a payment, a PayPal account holder enters the email address of the recipient and the payment amount, and selects a funding source—credit card, bank account or PayPal balance. In addition, with our Web Accept feature, merchants can accept PayPal payments directly from their websites. When a consumer who has not yet registered with PayPal visits the website of a merchant that has integrated Web Accept, the consumer can open a PayPal account from the merchant's site in order to make a purchase. Payment recipients may use their funds to make payments to others, leave the funds in their PayPal accounts and earn a money market rate of return, or withdraw the funds at any time by requesting a bank account transfer or a check delivered by mail or by using the PayPal ATM/debit card. When a PayPal sender makes an email payment to a recipient who does not yet have a PayPal account, the recipient follows a link in the payment notification email to register with PayPal and gain access to the funds. We have achieved our growth through a combination of the ""push"" nature of email payments to non-registered recipients and the ""pull"" nature of Web Accept. During the nine months ended September 30, 2001, our total number of accounts grew by 5.1 million, an average of 18,500 per day, at an average total marketing expense, including promotional bonuses, of $1.05 per new account. During the nine months ended September 30, 2001, we processed an average of 171,000 payments per day totaling $8.5 million in daily volume. For this period, the average payment amount sent equaled $50. To establish PayPal as the online payment standard, we will continue to identify transactions and markets not served adequately by existing payment systems and to develop product features that improve upon those legacy systems. In addition to growing our customer base, our business strategy includes the following: • Expand small business payment volume by continuing to develop and enhance the product features useful to small business customers; • Strengthen our position as the payment method of choice on online auctions by adding product features valued by auction participants; • Increase volume of international payments through development of a multi-currency platform and the addition of features that increase international access to our product; • Maintain low variable costs, particularly transaction losses, by employing proprietary risk management techniques; and • Grow PayPal ATM/debit card usage by broadening card distribution to qualified customers.

The Plumtree Corporate Portal allows an enterprise's employees, customers and partners to interact with different types of information and applications in one Web site and empowers users to create new information and services on the Web. Our software also supports a wide range of online business processes, so users can complete tasks more efficiently. For example, using our portal, a company's employees can use their e-mail, read competitive news or update a sales database, accessing multiple systems in one experience. Supervisors can also use our portal to assign projects and approve expenses. Similarly, a company's customers can use our portal to search for support articles, participate in an online discussion or access billing information. As a result, a company can consolidate its investments in Web- enabling critical systems, increase its return from those systems by broadening their audiences, and empower its employees, customers and partners to access these systems on their own, increasing productivity and improving service. We believe that the range of resources that our software can integrate and our proprietary Internet technology for performing this integration for hundreds of thousands of users, differentiate our solution and create significant value for our customers. We also provide professional services and training, maintenance and support services to our customers. Since 1997, we have licensed our portal to more than 325 customers from a broad range of industries and government, including AMR (American Airlines), Boeing, Bristol- Myers Squibb, Cadbury Schweppes plc, Duke Energy, Eli Lilly, Ford Motor Company, Ketchum, Merrill Lynch, National Institutes of Health, Pfizer, Pharmacia, Procter & Gamble, United Technologies Corporation, United States Air Force and United States Naval Air Systems Command, Washington Mutual and Zurich Insurance. Over the past several years, the Internet has transformed business by introducing broader audiences to computing and opening enterprises to new interactions with employees, customers and partners. The Internet has also transformed software by allowing previously incompatible electronic resources from formerly isolated systems to be integrated by private and public networks. As a result, the volume of information and the number of software applications available through the Internet has increased dramatically, prompting many organizations to invest in portal software that can combine an organization's most important information and applications into a single, personalized Web experience. However, there have been few solutions for integrating in one Web experience a wide range of resources from other systems. Attempts to develop in-house solutions often are costly, require significant resources and time, and provide limited functionality. Established software vendors are Web- enabling their own software applications, but often face architectural limitations when attempting to integrate data and services from other software applications. These vendors are unlikely to support access to data or services provided by an application from a competing vendor. For these reasons we believe there is a significant market opportunity for an independent supplier of commercial portal software. Our solution consists of the Plumtree Corporate Portal and Plumtree Gadget Web Services. The Plumtree Corporate Portal's document directory integrates content from a wide range of repositories such as file systems, Web sites and document databases. Gadget Web Services integrate into the portal interactive components from a wide range of enterprise applications from vendors such as Siebel, SAP and IBM. The portal combines these resources in personalized pages and in group pages known as communities. Plumtree also released two new products in the first quarter of 2002: the Plumtree Collaboration Server, which is designed to allow portal users to collaborate on projects within the portal, and the Plumtree Studio Server, which is designed to allow portal administrators to build new Gadget Web Services for the portal without coding. Our solution is based on infrastructure for integrating information and applications on an enterprise scale using Internet protocols. Our objective is to lead the corporate portal market with the most innovative technology and the most satisfied customers. Key elements of our strategy include: . Establish the Plumtree Corporate Portal as an enterprise platform; . Expand alliances with technology vendors and systems integrators; and . Increase our market share among industry-leading customers. For the year ended December 31, 2001, we had total revenue of $81.5 million and net loss of $3.1 million, excluding amortization of stock-based compensation and acquired technology. As of March 31, 2002, we had an accumulated deficit of $41.7 million. For the most recent quarter ended March 31, 2002, we had total revenue of $23.2 million and had net income of $1.8 million, excluding amortization of stock-based compensation and acquired technology.

Our enterprise resource planning and collaborative supply chain software solutions enable printers and print buyers to lower costs and improve productivity and enable printers to increase revenues. Our procurement applications, which are designed for print buyers, integrate with our software solutions designed for printers, and facilitate collaboration between printers and print buyers over the Web. Our software solutions for the printing industry supply chain have been installed by more than 4,000 customers in over 8,000 facilities worldwide, including 24 of the 25 largest printing companies in North America and over 50 businesses in the Fortune 1000. We believe that we offer the only integrated software solutions that enable printers and print buyers to increase efficiencies in each stage of the print production process, from specification and purchasing to manufacturing and distribution. We provide enterprise resource planning systems, which enable printers to manage internal business systems and processes; procurement systems, which streamline the purchasing process; and collaborative supply chain planning and execution systems, which automate the print production process for printers and print buyers. Since our inception in 1987, we have continually developed our software, targeted to the specific needs of the printing industry supply chain, by drawing on our years of experience in the printing industry and leveraging our relationships with our strategic partners and customers. We also provide our customers with maintenance and professional services, including consulting, implementation, and training. Our objective is to be the leading developer and provider of software solutions for the global printing industry supply chain. The production of printed material is complex and requires collaboration among multiple parties throughout the process to ensure that the final product accurately reflects the print buyer's design and meets its quality, cost, and delivery expectations. Printing jobs are often highly customized, involving last minute changes, and requiring numerous interactions among print buyers, printers, and print industry raw material suppliers. The characteristics of the printing industry lead to production inefficiencies throughout the supply chain. Printers, print buyers, and print industry raw material suppliers seek solutions that enable them to interact more efficiently with other participants in the print production process. Our solutions consist of both client/server software applications and hosted Web-based products. Our client/server-based enterprise resource planning systems and supply chain management products operate with a variety of databases and operating systems. Our Web-based products, which we host at our facility, are deployed on an Oracle database and are developed using readily available Web development tools. We expect to release an international version of our enterprise resource planning system for large commercial printers in the second quarter of 2002, expanding our reach into global markets. For the year ended December 31, 2001, we had $41.9 million of total revenue, $(8.7) million of EBITDA, net of other charges, which represents the net loss we would have shown if we did not take into consideration our total other expense (which includes interest expense), depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation and warrants, and restructuring charges, and $75.6 million of net loss attributable to common stock. For the quarter ended March 31, 2002, we had $11.7 million of total revenue, $0.3 million of EBITDA, net of other charges, and $13.2 million of net loss attributable to common stock. Founded in 1987 as Prograph Management Systems, Inc., our predecessor company, Prograph Systems, Inc., reincorporated in Delaware in February 2000 and changed its name to printCafe, Inc. in February 2000. In February 2002, printCafe, Inc. changed its name to Printcafe Software, Inc. Creo Inc., formerly Creo Products Inc., a leading supplier of pre-press equipment and workflow software to the graphic arts industry and a publicly-traded Canadian corporation, is our largest stockholder, through its wholly-owned subsidiary Creo SRL. Creo has indicated an interest in purchasing 370,000 shares of common stock in this offering. Following completion of this offering, and assuming Creo purchases these 370,000 shares, Creo would own 30.2% of our outstanding common stock. Creo has two representatives on our board of directors and is a party to several commercial agreements with us, including a strategic alliance agreement, a $23.6 million loan agreement through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Iris Graphics Inc., and a sales channel agreement with another wholly-owned subsidiary, Creo Scitex America, Inc. Obligations under the loan agreement with Iris Graphics are secured by substantially all of our assets. As of March 31, 2002, we were not in compliance with the quarterly cash flow covenant of this agreement, which would have resulted in an additional 3% of interest until the default was cured. Iris Graphics waived compliance with this covenant through June 30, 2002. We intend to repay $12.3 million of this loan, together with a prepayment fee of $3.7 million, with a portion of the net proceeds of this offering.

As of September 30, 2002, we provided our services to approximately 50,000 active small merchants located across the United States. The small merchants we serve typically generate less than $250,000 of charge volume per year and have an average transaction value of approximately $80. These merchants have traditionally been underserved by larger payment processors due to the difficulty in identifying, servicing and managing the risks associated with these merchants. As a result, these merchants have historically paid higher transaction fees than larger merchants. Our payment processing services enable merchants to process both traditional card-present, or “swipe,” transactions, as well as card-not-present transactions. A card-not-present transaction occurs whenever a customer does not physically present a payment card at the point-of-sale and may occur over the Internet or by mail, fax or telephone. Our processing services include evaluation and acceptance of card numbers, detection of fraudulent transactions, receipt and settlement of funds and service and support. By outsourcing some of these services to third parties, including the evaluation and acceptance of card numbers and receipt and settlement of funds, we maintain an efficient operating structure, which allows us to easily expand our operations without significantly increasing our fixed costs. We derive the majority of our revenues from fee income related to transaction processing, which is primarily comprised of a percentage of the dollar amount of each transaction we process, as well as a flat fee per transaction. In the event we have outsourced any of the services provided in the transaction, we remit a portion of the fee income to the third parties that have provided these services. We believe our experience and knowledge in providing payment processing services to small merchants gives us the ability to effectively identify, evaluate and manage the payment processing needs and risks that are unique to small businesses. We market and sell our services primarily through our relationships with over 500 independent sales organizations, or ISOs, which act as a non-employee, external sales force in communities throughout the United States. By providing the same high level of service and support to our ISOs as we do to our merchant customers, we maintain our access to an experienced sales force of approximately 2,000 sales professionals who will market our services, with minimal direct investment in sales infrastructure and management. After an ISO refers a merchant to us and we execute a processing agreement with that merchant, we pay the referring ISO a percentage of the revenues generated by that merchant. Although our relationships with ISOs are mutually non-exclusive, we believe that our understanding of the unique payment processing needs of small merchants enables us to develop compelling incentives for ISOs to continue to refer newly identified merchants to us. We also maintain an open dialogue with our ISOs, allowing us to quickly address their concerns and any problems facing the merchants they refer to us. The Nilson Report, a publication specializing in consumer payment systems worldwide, listed us in its 2001 ranking of the top bank card acquirers, or owners of merchant card processing contracts, as one of the fastest growing providers of card-based payment processing services in the United States. In the last twelve months, we have continued to grow as our merchant processing volume increased by 228.3% from approximately $459 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2001 to approximately $1,507 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2002. During the same period, our revenues increased by 184.6% from $23.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2001 to $67.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2002. This increase was primarily attributable to our acquisitions since January 2001 of six businesses and four portfolios of merchant accounts, which resulted in an aggregate increase in revenues of $36.3 million, representing 83.8% of our total growth in revenues over the prior period. As we have grown, our net loss decreased by 29.4% from $1.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2001 to $1.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2002. Our Market Opportunity According to The Nilson Report, total expenditures of transactions using card- based payment systems by U.S. consumers grew from $0.5 trillion in 1991, or 19% of all consumer payments, to $1.8 trillion in 2001, or 32% of total payments, and is expected to grow to $4.2 trillion by 2011, or 48% of total payments, which would represent a compound annual growth rate of 9% from 2001 levels. We believe that these increases are due to the benefits of card-based payment systems to both merchants and consumers. By accepting card-based payments, merchants can access a broader universe of consumers, enjoy faster settlement times and reduce transaction errors. By using credit or debit cards, consumers are able to make purchases more conveniently, whether in person, over the Internet, or by mail, fax or telephone, while gaining the benefit of loyalty programs, such as frequent flier miles or cash back, which are increasingly being offered by credit or debit card issuers. Consumers are also beginning to use card-based and other electronic payment methods for purchases at an earlier age. Given these advantages of card-based payment systems to both merchants and consumers, favorable demographic trends and the resulting proliferation of credit and debit card usage, we believe businesses will increasingly seek to accept card-based payment systems in order to remain competitive. We expect the small merchants we target to increasingly accept and benefit from the increased usage of card-based payment systems. The U.S. Census Bureau estimates that 20 million small businesses in the United States, defined as those with on average less than $1.0 million in annual sales, generate an aggregate of $1.7 trillion in annual sales. Many of these small businesses are seeking, and we expect many new small businesses to seek, to provide customers with the ability to pay for merchandise and services using credit or debit cards, including those in industries that have historically accepted cash and checks as the only forms of payment. For example, the prevalence of consumers making purchases on the Internet incentivizes small businesses to have an on- line presence and, we believe, increases their need to accept credit and debit cards as payment. Our Competitive Position The payment processing industry is highly competitive. Many of our competitors have substantially greater capital resources than we have and operate as subsidiaries of financial or bank holding companies, which may allow them to integrate their services to a greater extent than we can. However, we believe our competitive strengths include the following: • Strong Position and Substantial Experience in Our Target Market. As of September 30, 2002, we were providing card-based payment processing to approximately 50,000 active small merchants. We believe that while we have a competitive advantage over larger service providers because of our understanding of the unique payment processing needs and risks of small merchants, we also have a competitive advantage over service providers of a similar or smaller size that may lack our experience and resources. • Large, Experienced, Efficient Sales Force. Our relationships with over 500 ISOs provide us with an experienced sales force of over 2,000 individuals who market our services in local communities throughout the United States, with minimum investment in sales infrastructure and management on our part. We continually strive to strengthen these relationships by delivering superior service and support to the ISOs that refer merchants to us. • Scalable, Efficient Operating Structure. Our scalable, efficient operating structure allows us to easily expand our operations without significantly increasing our fixed costs. We conduct our customer service and risk management operations in-house, where we believe we can add the most value due to our management’s experience and expertise in these areas. We consider customer service and risk management highly important to our operations and overall success. We outsource our remaining processing services to third parties, including the evaluation and acceptance of card numbers and receipt and settlement of funds. By outsourcing these non-core services, we believe we are able to maintain a highly efficient operating structure. • Proven Acquisition and Integration Strategy. We have significant experience acquiring providers of payment processing services, as well as portfolios of merchant accounts, having acquired six providers of payment processing services and four portfolios of merchant accounts since January 2001. We have enhanced revenues and improved operating efficiencies of our acquired entities by improving the services, support and benefits we offer to the ISOs that serve the entities and merchant accounts we acquire. In addition, we have increased operating efficiencies of many of the businesses we have acquired by conducting profitability analyses of acquired merchant accounts and reducing processing fees and overhead. • Comprehensive Underwriting and Risk Management System. Through our experience assessing risks associated with providing payment processing services to small merchants, we have developed business procedures and systems that provide effective risk management and fraud prevention solutions. Our Strategy Our objective is to take advantage of the proliferation of small merchants and their increasing acceptance of card-based payment systems. We plan to build on our existing competitive strengths and further enhance our position as a provider of card-based payment processing services to small merchants. The principal elements of our strategy include the following: • Expand our portfolio of small merchants who use our processing services; • Enhance our relationships with those ISOs who currently refer small merchants to us and establish relationships with new ISOs; • Maintain a stable and recurring revenue base; and • Continue to pursue strategic acquisitions of other payment processing businesses, as well as individual portfolios of merchant accounts. Our History Our subsidiary, iPayment Technologies, Inc., was formed in 1992 as a California corporation. In July 2000, iPayment Technologies purchased assets from two former affiliates in exchange for the assumption of debt, cash, a note and the issuance of shares of common stock of iPayment Technologies. In December 2000, iPayment Technologies implemented a restructuring plan, which resulted in a reduction in overhead costs and personnel. In February 2001, Gregory Daily joined iPayment Technologies as its Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board. In February 2001, we were formed by the majority stockholders of iPayment Technologies under the name iPayment Holdings, Inc. as a holding company for iPayment Technologies and other card processing businesses. We then appointed Gregory Daily as our Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board. In April 2001, we acquired a 94.63% interest in iPayment Technologies, and in July 2002, we acquired the remaining outstanding shares of iPayment Technologies, which then became our wholly owned subsidiary, in each case by issuing our shares to iPayment Technologies stockholders in exchange for iPayment Technologies shares.

Our primary service offering, iPass Corporate Access, is designed to enable enterprises to provide their employees with secure access from approximately 150 countries to the enterprise’s internal networks through an easy-to-use interface. As opposed to telecommunications companies that own and operate physical networks, we provide our services through a virtual network. Our virtual network is enabled by our software, our scalable network architecture and our relationships with over 200 telecommunications carriers, Internet service providers and other network service providers around the globe. We pay network service providers for access, but do not incur the costs associated with building and maintaining physical networks. Our software is designed to provide enterprises with a high level of security, the ability to affect and control policy management, and centralized billing and detailed reporting. We provide our services predominantly over wired networks, and recently we have begun providing our services over wireless networks. We have generated 99% of our revenues to date from the sale of enterprise connectivity services using narrowband access technologies, such as modem dial-up, and seek to generate additional revenues from broadband access technologies, including wired broadband, or Ethernet, and wireless fidelity, or Wi-Fi. We market and sell our services directly, as well as indirectly through channel partners, which consist of network service providers, systems integrators and value-added resellers. Enterprises have achieved significant advances in productivity over the last decade by connecting employees to internal networks, and by broadly deploying network-based applications such as e-mail. While these developments have increased productivity for employees in their offices, it is becoming increasingly important for enterprises to make these applications available to employees working outside of the office as well. According to estimates by International Data Corporation, or IDC, a market research firm, the number of U.S. mobile workers will increase from approximately 92 million in 2002 to approximately 105 million in 2006, growing at almost twice the rate of the U.S. worker population in general. As a result, many enterprises today are seeking secure and cost-effective ways to provide mobile workers with access to critical corporate resources, such as internal applications and databases, in order to further increase productivity and to enhance their competitive position. Several factors in the telecommunications and technology industries make it challenging for enterprises to provide secure, high quality connectivity to mobile workers. These factors include the lack of a single network service provider with global coverage, the need to provide overlapping and redundant coverage to protect against service outages in geographic areas, the need to integrate and support complex access methods and devices, and increasing security concerns. iPass Corporate Access provides an enterprise’s mobile workers with the benefits of our software-enabled virtual network to address these challenges. Key benefits of our service include: • Broad Global Coverage. Our virtual network provides mobile workers with the ability to access their enterprise networks through one of over 18,000 access points. As of June 30, 2003, over 16,000 of these access points were dial-up connections and over 2,000 were broadband connections. • Redundant and Scalable Virtual Network. We create a scalable virtual network by using our software to access and link to the physical networks of over 200 service providers, which in most cases allows us to provide overlapping geographic coverage. Our geographically distributed software architecture is designed to reduce the risk of service interruptions. • Secure Connectivity. Our software is designed to provide an enterprise with a high level of security by enabling integration of our connectivity services with a wide variety of enterprise security applications. • Centralized Billing and Reporting. We offer centralized and detailed billing and reporting, which provide significant management and administrative benefits to our customers. 1 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Table of Contents • Integration of New Technologies. We help our customers manage the increasing complexity of access methods, devices, applications and operating systems by continuing to assess, test and integrate current and emerging major technologies. Our objective is to become the leading provider of secure enterprise connectivity services worldwide. To achieve this objective, we intend to: • expand our customer base; • increase penetration within our existing customer base; • expand our wired and wireless broadband service offerings; and • continue to enhance our virtual network and service offerings. Our business is subject to numerous risks, which are highlighted in the section entitled “Risk Factors” immediately following this prospectus summary. In particular, we have incurred significant operating losses in the past and may incur significant operating losses in the future. Although we were profitable in 2002 and in the first six months of 2003, $24.3 million of our $29.8 million in net income in 2002 was due to a non-recurring tax benefit.

Large enterprises use EIM systems to model, administer, analyze and report on pay-for- performance plans, which are designed to align employee, sales and channel tactics with targeted business objectives, and thereby increase productivity, improve profitability and achieve competitive advantage. Our product suite is based on our proprietary technology and extensive domain expertise and provides the flexibility and scalability required to meet the dynamic EIM requirements of large, complex businesses across multiple industries. Our installed base of over 75 active customers includes industry leaders in the insurance, retail banking, telecommunications, distribution, and manufacturing and technology industries, such as Allstate, JP Morgan Chase, AT&T Wireless, Airborne Express and Apple Computer. Our revenues were $26.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 and $29.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2003. Market Opportunity In today’s competitive environment, pay-for-performance programs are increasingly recognized as important tools for companies to increase sales and productivity, gain market share and improve profitability. In 2001, AMR, a leading industry analysis firm, estimated that more than $1.5 trillion of pay-for-performance compensation is paid out annually by U.S. and European based companies. However, the management of pay-for-performance programs presents complex challenges due to the large numbers of potential payees, compensation transactions, incentive programs and corporate policies involved. Currently, the majority of large businesses administer these programs using manual methods or internally developed solutions that do not adequately address these challenges. Failure to effectively meet these challenges erodes the effectiveness of incentive compensation, impairs management’s ability to adapt pay-for-performance programs to changing corporate objectives and results in costly errors. We believe that large enterprises are increasingly seeking dedicated EIM solutions to manage their pay-for-performance programs and, as a result, that the EIM market represents a substantial and growing new market opportunity. The Callidus Solution We develop, market, install and support a suite of rules-based EIM products to address the complex challenges of pay-for-performance programs for large enterprises. We provide a transparent and reliable data resource for enterprises to plan and manage pay-for-performance programs and accurately allocate credit among a wide range of payees. Our product suite allows management to accurately calculate and coordinate the payment of incentive compensation based on a highly flexible and scalable software architecture. In addition, our reporting product enables management to accurately and systematically report incentive compensation results to payees on a timely basis. Our solution is designed to enable large enterprises to achieve competitive advantages by ensuring that employees, agents and business partners are focused on targeted business objectives, thereby increasing productivity and driving bottom line results. We believe we provide the most advanced EIM solution available for three principal reasons: We Solve Complex Pay-for-Performance Problems. By focusing exclusively on solving the challenges and complexities inherent in pay-for-performance programs, we have developed a suite of EIM solutions designed to enable timely and accurate planning, calculation and management of variable, salary and management-by-objective (MBO) compensation, as well as dispute resolution, referral tracking and reporting. We Address Key Vertical Market Requirements. We believe domain expertise is critical to designing a successful EIM system. We apply our domain expertise to build specific functionality into our products to address the key requirements of the insurance, retail banking, telecommunications, distribution, and manufacturing and technology industries. We Have Superior Technology. Our products are based on our proprietary rules-based software and grid computing architecture. We believe this technology differentiates our products and offers superior performance, scalability and flexibility in an easy-to-use and reliable system, resulting in a lower total cost of ownership than manual methods and internally developed solutions. Strategy Our objective is to extend our leadership position in the EIM market for large businesses. To achieve this goal we are pursuing the following strategies: Capitalize on Our Technological Leadership. We intend to leverage our early-mover advantage and our technological leadership in the EIM market by continuing to invest in research and development to expand our product line and increase our products’ functionality, and thereby to capitalize on the EIM market opportunity. Continue Our Focus on Vertical Markets and Develop Additional Referenceable Accounts. Our domain expertise enables our products to offer industry-specific advantages in functionality, implementation and deployment and allows us to achieve greater efficiency and effectiveness in our sales, marketing and product development efforts. We intend to add marquee customers in each of our vertical markets and to leverage these referenceable accounts to increase penetration of our target markets. Increase the Industry-Specific Modeling and Analytic Capabilities of Our Products. We are developing new products and product enhancements to provide customers with more extensive industry-specific modeling and analytic capabilities required in increasingly competitive marketplaces. Continue to Build Loyalty Through Superior Customer Care. As we grow our installed base, we intend to increase our investment in customer care to further strengthen customer loyalty and referenceability.

We aggregate information on hotels and flights and enable our customers to make informed and cost-effective hotel and flight bookings. Since commencing operations in 1999, we have become one of the best-known travel brands in China. We pioneered the development of a reservation and fulfillment infrastructure that enables our customers to: • choose and reserve hotel rooms in cities throughout China and selected cities abroad; • book and purchase airline tickets for domestic and international flights originating from China; and • choose and reserve packaged tours that include transportation, accommodation, and sometimes guided tours as well. We target our services primarily at business and leisure travelers in China who do not travel in groups. This type of travelers, who are referred to in the travel industry as FITs and whom we refer to as independent travelers in this prospectus, form a traditionally under-served yet fast-growing segment of the China travel market. We act as agent in substantially all of our transactions and generally do not take any inventory risks with respect to the hotel rooms and airline tickets booked through us. We derive our hotel reservation, air-ticketing and packaged-tour revenues through commissions from our travel suppliers, primarily based on the transaction value of the rooms, airline tickets and packaged-tour products, respectively, booked through our services. For the nine months ended September 30, 2003, we derived 85.8% of our revenues from the hotel reservation business and 10.5% of our revenues from our air-ticketing business. Our packaged-tour business contributed 1.6% of our revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2003. We believe that we are the largest consolidator of hotel accommodations in China in terms of the number of room nights booked. In October 2003, we booked over 300,000 hotel room nights. As of October 31, 2003, we had secured room supply relationships with over 1,700 hotels in China and over 450 hotels abroad, which cover a broad range in terms of price and geographical location. The quality and depth of our hotel supplier network enable us to offer our customers a wide selection of hotel accommodations, often at significant discounts to published rates. We believe our ability to offer reservations at highly rated hotels is particularly appealing to our customers. Revenues from our bookings for three-, four- and five-star hotels comprised approximately 95.0% of our revenues from our hotel reservation business for the nine months ended September 30, 2003. We believe that we are also one of the leading consolidators of airline tickets in Beijing and Shanghai in terms of the number of airline tickets booked and sold. We sold more than 70,000 tickets nationwide in October 2003. Our airline ticket suppliers include all major Chinese airlines and many international airlines that operate flights originating from China. We also believe we are the only airline ticket consolidator in China with a centralized reservation system and ticket fulfilment infrastructure covering all of the economically prosperous regions of China. Our customers can make flight reservations on their chosen routes and arrange ticket payment and delivery through our ticketing offices and third-party agencies located in over 20 major cities in China. We offer our services to customers through an advanced transaction and service platform consisting of our centralized toll-free, 24-hour customer service center and bilingual websites. For the nine months ended September 30, 2003, transactions effected through our customer service center accounted for approximately 70% of our transaction volume, while our websites accounted for the balance. We have experienced significant growth since our inception in June 1999. Beginning in the first half of 2002, we have achieved and maintained positive net income. Our revenues have increased from RMB6.9 million in 2000 to RMB105.3 million (US$12.7 million) in 2002. For the nine months ended September 30, 2003, we generated revenues of RMB111.3 million (US$13.4 million) and net income of RMB29.2 million (US$3.5 million) despite the outbreak of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, or SARS, during the second quarter of 2003. ----- Corporate Information We were incorporated in the Cayman Islands.

Our platform combines an online storefront, proprietary supply chain management technology, established supplier relationships and an integrated logistical relationship with Federal Express Corporation to bypass legacy supply chains of wholesalers, distributors and retailers. The benefits to our customers include freshness, quality, price and selection, all with a guaranteed delivery date. The benefits to our suppliers include enhanced margins, broader customer reach and better inventory management. We believe our business model is highly scaleable with low capital investment requirements and minimal inventory carrying costs. Our marketplace is a collection of branded websites, each offering high-quality perishable products shipped directly from the supplier to the customer. Our solution allows us to eliminate multiple intermediaries from the legacy supply chain and realize significant cost advantages and higher margins. Our platform reduces or eliminates many of the typical costs associated with traditional retail businesses including inventory, capital expenditures, labor and administrative expenses. We have designed our technology infrastructure to be highly scalable and adaptable to different categories of time-sensitive shipments, including perishable products. We initially launched our solution to address the legacy supply chain for flowers, one of the most difficult perishable products to ship, under our Proflowers brand at www.proflowers.com. Our flowers are generally seven to nine days fresher than flowers delivered via the legacy floral supply chain. We guarantee that our flowers will reach their destination on the requested delivery date. We believe our global network of growers, proprietary technology and integrated relationship with Federal Express Corporation, or FedEx, provide us with a competitive advantage in the floral market. Our price points start at $29.99 and on average are significantly lower than other online floral merchants for comparable items, yet we believe we offer a higher quality and fresher product at higher margins.

We have built a well respected consumer brand by employing an informative sales process that empowers our customers while offering a broad selection of high quality jewelry at competitive prices. Our web site at www.bluenile.com showcases over 30,000 independently certified diamonds and more than 1,000 styles of fine jewelry, including rings, wedding bands, earrings, necklaces, pendants, bracelets and watches. We have developed an efficient online cost structure and a supply solution that eliminates traditional layers of diamond wholesalers and brokers, which allows us to purchase most of our product offerings at lower prices by avoiding mark-ups imposed by those intermediaries. Our supply solution also enables us to purchase only those diamonds that our customers have ordered. As a result, we are able to minimize the costs associated with carrying diamond inventory and limit our risk of potential mark-downs. We believe our suppliers benefit from improved capital efficiency, lower management costs, and access to real-time market intelligence. Consumers frequently view the purchase of diamonds or fine jewelry as a significant event, and often require substantial information and guidance before completing a purchase. Our web site and extensively trained customer service representatives improve the traditional purchasing experience by providing education and detailed product information that enable our customers to objectively compare diamonds and fine jewelry products and make informed decisions. Our web site features interactive search functionality that allows our customers to quickly find the products that meet their exact needs from our broad selection of diamonds and fine jewelry. In addition, we believe our customers benefit from the ability to customize their diamond jewelry, lower pricing, free shipping and our 30-day return guarantee.

Our business is subject to numerous risks, which are highlighted in the section entitled “Risk Factors” immediately following this prospectus summary. In particular, our limited operating history makes it difficult for us to accurately forecast net sales and appropriately plan for our expenses. Furthermore, we have incurred significant operating losses in the past and may incur significant operating losses in the future. In addition, except for loose diamonds, substantially all of the fine jewelry we sell is from our physical inventory.

We provide a comprehensive customer relationship management, or CRM, service to businesses of all sizes and industries worldwide. By designing and developing our service to be a low-cost, easy-to-use application that is delivered through a standard Web browser, we substantially reduce many of the traditional expenses and complexities of enterprise software implementations. As a result, our customers incur less risk and lower upfront costs. Our service helps customers more effectively manage critical operations including: sales force automation; customer service and support; marketing automation; document management; analytics; and custom application development. We market our services on a subscription basis, primarily through our direct sales efforts and also indirectly through partners. From the introduction of our service in February 2000 through October 31, 2003, our customer base had grown to approximately 8,000 subscribing customers, with an aggregate of over 110,000 paying subscribers in approximately 70 countries. The pervasiveness of the Internet, along with the dramatic declines in the pricing of computing technology and network bandwidth, have enabled a new generation of enterprise computing in which substantial components of information technology, or IT, infrastructure can be provisioned and delivered dynamically on an outsourced basis. This new computing paradigm is sometimes referred to as utility computing, while the outsourced software applications are referred to as on-demand application services. On-demand application services enable businesses to subscribe to a wide variety of application services that are developed specifically for, and delivered over, the Internet on an as-needed basis with little or no implementation services required and without the need to install and manage third-party software in-house. The market for on-demand application services is projected to grow from $425 million in 2002 to $2.6 billion in 2007, which represents a compounded annual growth rate of 44 percent, according to a May 2003 report by International Data Corporation, or IDC, an independent market research firm. We believe that the CRM applications market, which was approximately $7.1 billion in 2002 according to a July 2003 report by IDC, is one of the first to benefit from on-demand application services. CRM applications are intended to enable businesses to automate sales, customer service and support and marketing. Despite the significant potential benefits that can be attained from CRM, many enterprises have failed to successfully deploy the CRM applications that they have purchased for a variety of reasons including the difficulty and relatively high cost of implementing and maintaining enterprise applications, as well as the historically low rates of user adoption and lack of ubiquitous access that have contributed to lower returns on investment in CRM deployments. From inception, our service has been specifically designed to provide customers with robust CRM solutions on an outsourced basis through our proprietary, scalable and secure multi-tenant application architecture. Key benefits of our solution include: † Rapid deployment. Our service can be deployed rapidly and provisioned easily, since our customers do not have to spend time installing or maintaining the servers, networking equipment, security products or other infrastructure hardware and software necessary to ensure a scalable and reliable service. † Enable high levels of user adoption. We have designed our service to be easy-to-use and intuitive. Since our service contains many tools and features recognizable to users of popular websites such as those of Amazon.com, eBay and Yahoo!, it has a more familiar interface than typical CRM applications. As a result, our users do not require substantial training on how to use and benefit from our service. † Lower total cost of ownership. We enable customers to achieve significant savings relative to the traditional enterprise software model. Our service enables customers to automate sales, customer service and support and marketing processes without having to make large and risky upfront investments in software, hardware and implementation services and additional IT staff. † Extensive features, functionality and configurability. We offer a comprehensive array of CRM capabilities across sales, customer service and support and marketing that meet the needs of businesses of any size. We also enable customers to tailor important characteristics of our service to meet their unique requirements without the use of significant IT resources. † Secure, scalable and reliable delivery platform. We built and maintain a multi-tenant application architecture that has been designed to enable our service to scale securely, reliably and cost-effectively to tens of thousands of customers and millions of users. † Ease of integration. We have developed a set of application programming interfaces, or APIs, which we provide on a platform we call sforce, that enable customers and independent developers to integrate our service with existing third-party, custom and legacy applications and write their own application services that integrate with our service. Our objective is to be the leading provider of on-demand application services for businesses worldwide. To achieve this objective we intend to: † continue to lead the industry transformation to on-demand application services; † strengthen and extend our service offering; † pursue new customers and new territories aggressively; † deepen relationships with our existing customer base; and † encourage the development of third-party applications on our sforce platform.

These high costs are the result of the many manual and inefficient processes required of both the providers and consumers of technology products—processes such as activation, set-up, troubleshooting, updating and repair. Our software optimizes these processes by embedding self-management services directly into our customers’ technology products. Our product suite includes three distinct types of service management products. Our Self-Management products optimize management processes for the end users and administrators of technology-enabled products and services. Our Service Operations Management products optimize the processes involved in delivering service and support for these complex technology products and services, simplifying and streamlining the operations of large-scale call centers and advanced remote technical support teams. Our Policy Management products enable product vendors and service providers to manage the usage of their products and services according to business objectives and policy guidelines. As technology-enabled products and services have proliferated, companies have struggled with the time-consuming, labor-intensive and error-prone management processes that surround them. Service management software is an emerging category of management infrastructure software designed to optimize the effectiveness and efficiency of these management processes. Service management software takes a top-down, business-driven view of the ecosystem of people, processes and technology that work together in support of the most strategic products and services offered by a company. According to International Data Corporation, the market opportunity for service-centric management software is anticipated to grow from an estimated $1.7 billion in 2004 to an estimated $3.5 billion in 2007. We believe that service management software has become a primary driver of growth in the broader $10 billion systems and network management software industry. ---------------------------- We were formed in 1997.

Our dedication to putting users first is reflected in three key commitments we have made to our users: • We will do our best to provide the most relevant and useful search results possible, independent of financial incentives. Our search results will be objective and we will not accept payment for inclusion or ranking in them. • We will do our best to provide the most relevant and useful advertising.

We actively manage the Greenfield Online panel, a 100% Internet-based panel of approximately 1.7 million individuals who participate in our surveys. Our panelists represent households consisting of an estimated 4.7 million people, allowing us to compile diverse, demographically representative survey data. We target our Internet survey solutions to approximately 2,500 full service marketing research and consulting firms in the United States and the world’s top 25 marketing research companies. Our clients use the Internet survey data that we provide to enable companies throughout the world to make critical business decisions. Based on our internal estimates, we believe that spending associated with the gathering of survey data, known as fieldwork, accounts for approximately 40% of the annual spending on survey marketing research. Using this estimate, fieldwork represented approximately $3.0 billion of the $7.5 billion global survey market in 2002 as reported by the World Association of Opinion and Marketing Research Professionals . Until January 2002, we sold both custom Internet-based marketing research and the Internet survey solutions we sell today. A majority of our revenues for the first seven years of our existence was derived from the sale of custom research. In September 2001, we embarked on a strategy to convert the focus of our business from providing custom research to end-users to providing Internet survey solutions to the marketing research firms we target today. This strategy culminated in the sale of our custom research business in January 2002. This sale represented a turning point in our development as we shifted from a labor-intensive, professional services model to a scalable, Internet-based services model. We partner with our clients to leverage their global sales forces and do not compete with them for custom marketing research business. This cooperative marketing strategy has led to significant market penetration. For the year ended December 31, 2003, we completed 2,482 Internet-based projects, a 99% increase over 2002.

Our objective is to be a leader in terms of growth, profitability, technological innovation, and business model innovation. We anticipate achieving our objectives through a combination of consolidation opportunities, growing those businesses we acquire, internal development initiatives and strategic relationships. We believe there is a significant, long-term opportunity to capture market share of online transactions, and services that support online transactions, by building a profitable, diversified global company that provides a wide range of technology-based services to merchants, including: Web site infrastructure and development services; online payment and commerce infrastructure; promotional tools to market and sell products and services; and automated tools to manage and track online transactions. We intend to leverage the experience of our senior management to capture this opportunity, as they have substantial operational and strategic experience, including experience in building and managing public companies, executing acquisitions and forming strategic relationships. Our current operating businesses are in the performance-based advertising and search marketing industries, primarily focused on helping merchants market and sell their products and services via the Internet. We currently provide our merchant customers with the following technology-based services: • Performance-Based Advertising primarily includes pay-per-click and paid inclusion services. • Pay-Per-Click Services . With pay-per-click services, merchant advertisers purchase keywords based on an amount they choose for a targeted placement, usually within search engine results. • Paid Inclusion Services . With paid inclusion services, merchant advertisers pay for their Web pages and product databases to be crawled, or searched, and indexed and included primarily within search engine and shopping engine results. Generally, the paid inclusion results are presented separately from the pay-per-click results. • Search Marketing is designed for merchant advertisers who are focused on acquiring customers through search-based marketing methods, such as pay-per-click management (“advertising campaign management”), enhancing the performance of their campaigns through tracking and analyzing historical results (“conversion tracking and analysis”), and refining their Web sites for increased relevance in algorithmic search engine indexes (“search engine optimization”). In support of our partners and merchants, we devote resources to developing and building proprietary technology-based products and services that we believe are innovative and provide a high degree of utility. Additionally, we continually evaluate opportunities to evolve existing technologies and business models, and we regularly consider possible acquisitions and strategic relationships. Internet-based transactions between consumers and merchants have grown rapidly in recent years. This growth is the result of decreasing price points of Internet access devices coupled with corresponding performance gains of such devices; a large installed base of personal computers in the workplace and home; penetration of broadband technologies and increased Internet usage; and the emergence of compelling commerce opportunities and a growing awareness among consumers of the convenience and other benefits of online shopping. We believe that today’s consumers are becoming increasingly confident that they can find comprehensive product information and securely transact online. Additionally, we believe merchants’ abilities to more efficiently and effectively acquire and monetize customers have also led to a steady increase in merchants coming online and therefore in the number of online transactions. We believe there is a significant, long-term opportunity to capture market share of online transactions and services that support online transactions, by building a profitable, diversified global company that provides a wide range of technology-based services to merchants, including: Web site infrastructure and development services; online payment and commerce infrastructure; promotional tools to market and sell products and services; and automated tools to manage and track online transactions.

Our comprehensive customer service solution features a self-learning knowledgebase to ensure accurate and consistent interactions with customers.

We offer our solutions through a multi-tenant, hosted on-demand model that reduces the cost and risk associated with deploying traditional enterprise customer relationship management, or CRM, software. To increase the satisfaction and loyalty of our clients, we provide value added services such as business process optimization and product tune-ups throughout the lifecycle of our relationship with our clients. Since 1998, we have achieved 25 consecutive quarters of sequential revenue growth. For the quarter ended March 31, 2004, our total revenue was $12.9 million, as compared to $7.8 million during the same quarter in 2003. As of March 31, 2004, we had more than 1,000 active clients, including large, medium and small enterprises. Our on-demand clients serviced more than 102 million customer interactions directly through our customer service solutions for the quarter ended March 31, 2004, as compared to 53 million customer interactions in the same quarter in 2003. We believe the emergence of on-demand application services has the potential to transform the enterprise application software industry, enabling faster deployment, higher return-on-investment and lower total cost of ownership. On-demand application services are accessed over existing Internet architectures through Internet web browsers in a secure and scalable manner, greatly simplifying the application delivery process, compared to traditional enterprise software that is implemented and deployed on-site within an organization's internal information technology, or IT, environment. We believe the on-demand model expands the addressable market opportunity for many enterprise software applications by making them more affordable for divisions of large corporations, middle-market companies and small businesses. The market for on-demand application services is projected to grow from $665 million in 2003 to $3.6 billion in 2008, a compounded annual growth rate of 41%, according to International Data Corporation, or IDC. Our solution is focused on the market for customer service applications. According to IDC, the customer service and contact center applications market accounted for $2.6 billion, or 36%, of the $7.2 billion CRM applications market in 2003. We believe that customer service applications are strategically important to businesses because they play a critical role in cost-effectively improving customer satisfaction and can serve as a comprehensive record of customer interactions and integrate with other systems to create a single view of the customer. We also believe customer service organizations have a significantly greater and more diverse level of customer interaction compared to sales and marketing organizations, and therefore require more robust solutions. Furthermore, we believe businesses have an opportunity to use their customer service applications to proactively anticipate and solve customer problems and drive revenue through cross-selling and up-selling, rather than simply providing reactive customer service. -------- We were incorporated in Montana in September 1995 and reincorporated in Delaware in August 2000.

Our network of websites, including our flagship websites Gay.com and PlanetOut.com, allows our members, or those visitors who registered on our websites by providing us with a name, e-mail address and other personal data, to connect with other members of the LGBT community around the world. According to Nielsen NetRatings, in June 2004, Gay.com ranked second in terms of average time online per person and sixteenth in terms of visits per person among all websites measured. We generate most of our revenue from subscription fees for premium membership services that we offer in English, French, German, Italian, Portuguese and Spanish to our members who identify themselves as residing in more than 100 countries. We also generate revenue from online advertising and e-commerce targeted to the LGBT community. Our membership base is large and growing. We believe that our base of over 3.3 million active members, or those members who have logged on at least once during the preceding twelve months, constitutes the most extensive network of gay and lesbian people in the world.

Through our global reach, we believe that we are able to provide advertisers with unparalleled access to the LGBT community. We generate revenue from run-of-site advertising, an advertising option in which advertisements are displayed across all sections of a website or a family of websites, advertising within specialized content channels and on our online-community areas, member-targeted emails and research for our advertisers. We have run advertising campaigns on our network for numerous Fortune 500 and other companies.

Utilizing proprietary technology, the Company has designed a fully-scalable systems architecture for the Internet shopping marketplace. Shopping.com's system is designed to fully integrate all aspects of retail transaction processing including, order placement, secure payment verification, inventory control, order fulfillment and vendor invoicing, in one seamless and automated process. The Company believes that the principal competitive factors in its market are price, speed of fulfillment, brand name recognition, wide selection, personalized services, ease of use, 24-hour accessibility, customer service, convenience, reliability, quality of search engine tools, and quality of editorial and other site content. The Company has developed a creative wholetailing format on the World Wide Web (""Web"") that combines a highly automated infrastructure with a user-friendly interface designed to enhance the convenience and ease of online shopping. The Company employs specialized information systems to provide its customers with access to an automated marketplace of products and services, which consist of the inventories of multiple manufacturers and distributors, price comparisons, detailed product descriptions, product availability, available delivery times, delivery status of products ordered and back-order information. Product categories currently available on the Company's Web site include: automotive, books, cigars, collectibles, computer hardware and software, consumer electronics, cutlery, fragrances, furniture, gifts, gourmet foods, health and beauty care, home improvements, marine supplies, music CDs, sporting goods and watches. The Company has, and will continue to enter into, arrangements with a number of manufacturers and distributors who will ship their products directly to its customers, avoiding the expense and delay of inventory maintenance. Although the Company only commenced selling on the Internet on July 11, 1997, Shopping.com currently offers more than 900,000 Stock Keeping Units (""SKUs"") and expects the number of SKUs to increase to over 2,000,000 by March 1998. Customers order products and services on Shopping.com's Web site and provide secure payment by either credit card over the Internet through Verisign or by calling 1-888-LOVE-2-SHOP. Shipments are then made by the manufacturer or distributor directly to the customer after verification by Shopping.com that the payment has been properly credited. Because transactions are accomplished without the need to maintain either inventory, warehouse facilities, retail store space or attendant personnel, the Company believes it will be able to obtain market share by passing cost savings along to its customers as a result of selling its products and services at a discount to typical retail and warehouse/discount prices. For the same reasons, the Company is also able to provide a broader merchandise mix than retail stores, warehouse/discount stores and mail order catalogue operators. Shopping.com's strategy is to become a dominant low-price leader in wholetailing on the Internet by utilizing the warehousing, purchasing and distribution strengths of multiple manufacturers and distributors, rather than to assume those roles for itself. The Company believes this approach allows Shopping.com to eliminate many of the risks and costs associated with maintaining inventory, including the cost of leasing warehouse space, inventory obsolescence, inventory tracking systems, as well as the increased costs associated with employing large numbers of personnel for stocking and shipping duties. By having access to the inventories of multiple manufacturers and distributors, Shopping.com believes it is able to offer its customers a competitive combination of price, product availability, order fulfillment and delivery services and still obtain profitability. Beyond the benefits of a wide selection, purchasing from Shopping.com can be done conveniently, 24 hours a day, without requiring a trip to a store. International Data Corporation (""IDC"") estimates that the number of users accessing the Web will grow from 28 million in 1996 to 175 million in 2001 and that the amount of commerce conducted over the Web will increase from approximately $2.6 billion in 1996 to $220 billion in 2001. Growth in Internet usage has been fueled by a number of factors, including the large and growing base of personal computers installed in the workplace and home, advances in the performance and speed of personal computers and modems, improvements in network infrastructure, easier and cheaper access to the Internet and increased awareness of the Internet among consumer and trade customers. The emergence of the Internet as a significant communications medium is driving the development and adoption of Web content and commerce applications that offer both convenience and value to consumers, as well as unique marketing opportunities and reduced operating costs to businesses. A growing number of consumer and trade customers have begun to conduct business on the Internet including paying bills, booking airline tickets, trading securities and purchasing consumer goods (e.g., personal computers, consumer electronics, compact disks, books, groceries and vehicles). Moreover, online transactions can be faster, less expensive and more convenient than transactions conducted through a human intermediary. The Company commenced operations in February 1996, incorporated in California on November 22, 1996, and began selling products and services on its Web site on July 11, 1997.

Our more than 500 active institutional investor client firms (firms that have executed at least one trade through our electronic trading platform between October 2003 and September 2004) can access the aggregate liquidity provided by the collective interest of our 19 broker-dealer clients in buying or selling bonds through our platform. We also provide data and analytical tools that help our clients make trading decisions and we facilitate the trading process by electronically communicating order information between trading counterparties. Since our inception, the majority of our revenues has been generated from the trading of U.S. high-grade corporate bonds, although an increasing percentage of our revenues has recently been derived from the trading of European high-grade corporate bonds. The vast majority of our commissions are generated from transactions between a broker-dealer client and an institutional investor client. Our multi-dealer trading platform allows our institutional investor clients to simultaneously request competing, executable bids or offers from our broker-dealer clients, and execute trades with the broker-dealer of their choice from among those that choose to respond. We offer our broker-dealer clients a solution that enables them to efficiently reach our institutional investor clients for the distribution and trading of bonds. In addition to U.S. high-grade corporate bonds and European high-grade corporate bonds, we also offer our clients the ability to trade emerging markets bonds, which we define as sovereign and corporate bonds issued by entities domiciled in an emerging markets country, including both high-grade and non-investment grade debt. To date, however, emerging markets bonds do not represent a significant component of our revenues. In addition, we recently started to provide our institutional investor clients with the ability to trade U.S. Treasury securities electronically through our broker-dealer clients in the inter-dealer market. We derive our revenues primarily from commissions paid by our broker-dealer clients for trades executed on our platform (which represented 92% of our revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2004) and, to a lesser extent, from information and user access fees charged to our clients (which represented 3% of our revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2004) and license fees for access to our trading platform charged to certain of our broker-dealer clients (which represented 3% of our revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2004). Traditionally, bond trading has been a manual process with product and price discovery conducted over the telephone between two or more parties. This traditional process, which is still how most corporate bonds are traded, has a number of shortcomings resulting primarily from the lack of a central trading facility for these securities, which creates difficulty matching buyers and sellers for particular issues. In recent years, an increasing number of corporate bond trading participants have utilized e-mail and other electronic means of communication (including proprietary, single-dealer systems) for trading corporate bonds. While this has addressed some of the shortcomings associated with traditional corporate bond trading, we believe that the process is still hindered by limited liquidity, limited price transparency, significant transaction costs, compliance and regulatory challenges, and difficulty in executing numerous trades at one time. Through our electronic platform, our institutional investor clients can determine prices available for a security, a process called price discovery, as well as trade securities directly with our broker-dealer clients. The price discovery process includes the ability to view indicative prices from the broker-dealer clients’ inventory available on our platform, access to real-time pricing information and analytical tools (including spread-to-Treasury data, search capabilities and independent credit research) available on our Corporate BondTickerTM service and the ability to request executable bids and offers simultaneously from up to 17 of our broker-dealer clients during the trade process. On average, institutional investor clients receive several bids or offers from broker-dealer clients in response to trade inquiries. However, some trade inquiries may not receive any bids or offers. Our services relating to trade execution include single- and multiple-dealer inquiries; list trading, which is the ability to request bids and offers on multiple bonds at the same time; and swap trading, which is the ability to request an offer to purchase one bond and a bid to sell another bond, in a manner such that the two trades will be executed simultaneously, with payment based on the price differential of the bonds. Once a trade is completed on our platform, the broker-dealer client and institutional investor client may settle the trade with the assistance of our automated post-trade messaging, which facilitates the communication of trade acknowledgment and allocation information between our institutional investor and broker-dealer clients. We are not a party to the actual trades that occur on our platform and we do not at any time take title to the traded securities or the proceeds from the sale of such securities. Rather, we serve as an intermediary between broker-dealers and institutional investors, enabling them to meet, agree on a price, and then transact with each other. Our client base includes 19 of the leading broker-dealers in global fixed-income trading and more than 500 active institutional investor firms (firms that have executed at least one trade through our electronic trading platform between October 2003 and September 2004), including 80 of the top 100 global holders of U.S. corporate bonds, as measured by Thomson Financial. Our broker-dealer clients accounted for approximately 98% of the underwriting of newly-issued U.S. high-grade corporate bonds and approximately 59% of the underwriting of newly-issued European high-grade corporate bonds in 2003, and include 9 of the top 10 broker-dealers as ranked by 2003 new-issue underwriting volume of European high-grade corporate bonds. We believe these broker-dealers also represent the principal source of secondary market liquidity in such securities, as well as in sovereign and corporate bonds issued by entities domiciled in an emerging markets country. Secondary market liquidity refers to the ability of market participants to buy or sell a security quickly and in large volume subsequent to the original issuance of the security, without substantially affecting the price of the security. Our broker-dealer clients currently trade fixed-income securities by traditional means including telephone, e-mail and proprietary, single-dealer systems in addition to our electronic trading platform and we expect them to continue to do so in the future. While we have not identified a reliable source of data relating to the total volume of client-to-dealer trading in these markets and, therefore, are unable to determine the portion of the trading that is taking place on our platform, we believe that these traditional means of trading corporate bonds remain the manner in which the majority of corporate bonds are traded between institutional investors and broker-dealers. Results for Calendar Years 2001, 2002 and 2003 From the time of the commercial launch of our electronic trading platform in January 2001 through the end of 2003, we experienced significant growth in total trading volume, total commissions and net income, as illustrated in the following table: Year Ended December 31, --------------------------------- 2001 2002 2003 --------- --------- --------- Total trading volume (unaudited) (in billions) $ 11.7 $ 48.4 $ 192.2 Total commissions (in millions) 4.3 15.6 52.8 Net income (loss) (in millions) (65.1 ) (36.1 ) 4.2 For the year ended December 31, 2003, 73.0% of our trading volume was in U.S. high-grade corporate bonds, 16.5% of our trading volume was in European high-grade corporate bonds and 10.5% of our trading volume was in other bonds, most of which are sovereign and corporate bonds issued by entities domiciled in an emerging markets country. We do not derive a material amount of revenues from commissions on trades of these other bonds. Results for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2003 and 2004 The following table illustrates our total trading volume, total commissions and net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2003 and for the nine months ended September 30, 2004: Nine Months Ended September 30, ----------------------- 2003 2004 --------- ----------- (unaudited) Total trading volume (in billions) $ 129.0 $ 218.8 Total commissions (in millions) 37.1 51.4 Net income (in millions) 2.5 56.0 (a) -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- (a) During the nine months ended September 30, 2004, we reduced the valuation allowance relating to our deferred tax assets by $46.1 million from $64.3 million to $18.2 million due to the fact that we had achieved multiple quarters of profitability and, therefore, it became more likely than not that we would be able to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards. The valuation allowance was reduced for the six months ended June 30, 2004 as we determined that it was more likely than not that all of the temporary differences relating to the deductibility of certain expenses for book and tax purposes attributable to warrant-related expenses would be utilized prior to expiration. Without giving effect to this reduction of the valuation allowance, our net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2004 would have been $10.0 million. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates — Income Taxes.” While our commissions and our total trading volume have increased significantly during the nine months ended September 30, 2004 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2003, and while our commissions and our total trading volume during the three months ended March 31, 2004 were significantly higher than the comparable figures during each quarter of 2003, our overall trading volume declined during the three months ended June 30, 2004 and during the three months ended September 30, 2004 as compared to the trading volume during the three months ended March 31, 2004, as illustrated in the following table: Three Months Ended ------------------------------------------- March 31, June 30, September 30, 2004 2004 2004 ----------- ---------- ---------------- (unaudited) Total trading volume (in billions) $ 75.0 $ 69.1 $ 74.7 Total commissions (in millions) 17.8 16.8 16.8 Net income (in millions) 2.9 44.0 (a) 9.1 (a) -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- (a) During the six months ended June 30, 2004, we reduced the valuation allowance relating to our deferred tax assets by $42.6 million from $64.3 million to $21.7 million due to the fact that we had achieved multiple quarters of profitability and, therefore, it became more likely than not that we would be able to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards. The valuation allowance was revised for the six months ended June 30, 2004 as we determined that it was more likely than not that all of the temporary differences relating to the deductibility of certain expenses for book and tax purposes attributable to warrant-related expenses would be utilized prior to expiration. Without giving effect to this reduction of the valuation allowance, our net income for the three months ended June 30, 2004 would have been $1.4 million. Without giving effect to this reduction of the valuation allowance, our net income for the three months ended September 30, 2004 would have been $5.6 million.

We operate our business in three business segments: wireless activation and services, MVNO services and data services. Wireless activation and services. We sell wireless services and devices to consumers through websites that we create and manage for third parties under their own brands. These third parties include online businesses, member-based organizations and associations, and national retailers, whom we refer to collectively as marketers. We also sell services and devices through our own branded websites, including Wirefly.com. Our five largest sources of customers include websites that we create and manage for Yahoo, Quixtar, MSN and AOL, and Google, through which we generate customers for our own branded websites by purchasing advertising. MVNO services. We also provide wireless services for consumers through wireless airtime service that we purchase wholesale from Sprint. We provide such services as a mobile virtual network operator, or MVNO, under our Liberty Wireless brand. This service utilizes the same e-commerce platform, operational infrastructure and marketing relationships we have developed for our wireless activation and services segment to sell wireless services and devices, resulting in what we believe is a cost-effective means of acquiring customers. We also plan to offer marketers the ability to sell wireless services, or MVNO services, to their customers under their own brands using the same e-commerce platform, operational infrastructure and wholesale wireless airtime that we purchase. Data Services. We leverage the relationships we have established with customers through the sale of wireless services from carriers, as well as our MVNO service, to sell a variety of wireless data services such as unified communications, wireless e-mail and mobile marketing. Our unified communications services allow carriers and us to provide customers with the ability to organize personal communications by providing access to e-mail, voicemail, faxes, contacts, scheduling, calendar and conference calling functionality through a website or telephone. Our mobile marketing services allow carriers and us to deliver wireless advertising and subscription-based content services to the wireless devices of customers to strengthen both marketing efforts and brand awareness. We have developed a proprietary e-commerce information technology platform that integrates merchandising, provisioning, procurement, customer care and billing operations into a single system for the online sale of wireless services and devices. This platform, which uses a combination of internally developed and licensed technologies, has been designed to serve as a foundation for us to build upon, offer additional products and services and to maximize performance, scalability, reliability and security. For example, this platform supports both the websites that we create and manage for third-party marketers as well as our own branded websites and allows us to manage the sale of wireless services and devices offered from wireless carriers, our Liberty Wireless MVNO service, and MVNO services offered by marketers under their own brands. Our revenues include commissions, bonuses and other payments we receive from wireless carriers in connection with the activation of customers on their networks, as well as payments from customers for wireless services and devices. For 2003, total revenues and net loss were $136.1 million and $20.2 million, respectively. For the three months ended September 30, 2004, total revenues and net loss were $54.1 million and $1.1 million, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2004, total revenues and net loss were $144.2 million and $8.9 million, respectively. For 2003, revenues from our wireless activation and services segment, MVNO services segment and our data services segment represented $91.2 million, $36.1 million, and $8.9 million, respectively. For the three months ended September 30, 2004, revenues from the same three segments represented $39.1 million, $13.2 million, and $1.7 million, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2004, revenues from the same three segments represented $100.6 million, $38.1 million, and $5.6 million, respectively. Revenues from our top three wireless carriers represented 49%, 46%, and 43% of our total revenues for 2003, the three months ended September 30, 2004, and the nine months ended September 30, 2004, respectively. During our limited history of operations, we have incurred significant losses and had negative cash flow from operations. As of September 30, 2004, we had an accumulated deficit of $118.6 million and a total stockholders’ deficit of $74.3 million. In recent years, use of wireless communication services has grown significantly in the United States fueled by enhanced convenience, mobility and affordability. As wireless carriers face increasing competition, excess network capacity as well as new challenges resulting from wireless local number portability, they are turning to the Internet as a cost-effective and growing channel to acquire customers. In addition, as consumers are faced with an increasingly complex and constantly changing selection of wireless service plans and devices, they are turning to the Internet to find real-time comparative pricing and feature information to help them make an informed choice. As a result of these trends, we believe the proportion of wireless services and devices sold on the Internet will grow, creating a significant market opportunity for us. We believe our online business model connects wireless carriers, marketers and consumers of wireless services and devices more effectively and efficiently than traditional retail channels. Wireless carriers benefit from broader access to consumers who shop on the Internet through our marketing relationships with highly-trafficked websites as well as our own branded websites. We also believe that our model provides wireless carriers with a cost-effective means of acquiring new customers. Marketers benefit by generating additional revenue from the marketing fees that we pay them for selling wireless services and devices through the private-labeled websites we create and manage. Marketers also benefit from our broad carrier relationships and selection of service plans and devices. Consumers benefit from competitive pricing, broad selection and the convenience of using the websites we create and manage for our marketers as well as our own branded websites for comparing and purchasing wireless services and devices. Through agreements we have with the seven largest U.S. wireless carriers, as well as with several regional carriers, we offer consumers a selection of at least four carriers in each of the top 100 U.S. metropolitan markets. Collectively, these carriers’ networks cover 99.4% of the U.S. population. Because our agreements with the wireless carriers are non-exclusive, we also compete against the services and devices that they offer directly or through third-party retailers, both online and offline. Our business is subject to numerous risks, which are highlighted in the section entitled “Risk Factors” immediately following this prospectus summary. In particular, our limited operating history makes it difficult for us to accurately forecast revenues and appropriately plan for our expenses. Furthermore, we have incurred significant operating losses in the past and may incur significant operating losses in the future.

Advertisers pay us to place their Internet ads on third-party websites in our network and we share the revenue we receive from placing those ads with the website owners, or publishers, that provided the ad space. Our technologies and services, including our proprietary Optimization Engine, Internet ad placement bidding system, and reporting and campaign management tools, are designed to improve the effectiveness of Internet ad campaigns and provide advertisers with an increased return on their advertising expenditures. We believe our technologies and services also enhance the value of Internet ad space available on our network of more than 8,000 third-party websites. Utilizing advanced mathematical algorithms, our proprietary Optimization Engine is designed to continuously analyze Internet user responses to various advertising campaign elements. Our Optimization Engine then automatically delivers ads to the websites yielding the greatest number of Internet user responses that meet the advertiser's campaign objectives. Based on this analysis, our Optimization Engine continuously refines an advertiser's campaign to emphasize the elements of the campaign that meet the advertiser's campaign objectives, such as the use of specific creative content, and removes elements that do not achieve the advertiser's campaign objectives, such as ads that underperform on a specific website. Our ad placement bidding system prices ad space based on current supply and demand for ad space on our network. Advertisers bidding the highest price receive priority delivery of their ads, subject to certain rules which may be set by us, our advertisers or our publishers. Our network reached over 115 million unique Internet users in January 2005 according to comScore Media Metrix, giving our network one of the broadest reaches of any Internet advertising network. In determining the number of unique Internet users, comScore Media Metrix counts visitors only once in a given month regardless of the number of times they visit a website. We have built our network of over 8,000 third-party websites by offering publishers attractive pricing and revenue sharing arrangements, easy-to-use, web-based tools and quality service. Our network includes branded websites that offer large volumes of ad space as well as a substantial number of websites that reach Internet users with highly-targeted demographics and interests. We placed over 6.5 billion ads in December 2004. Our top ten advertisers accounted for 47.6% and 45.8% of our ad revenue for 2003 and 2004, respectively. --------------- We were incorporated in California in March 2000 and reincorporated in Delaware on March 29, 2005.

This ranking represented 1.8% of the total bank card processing market. As of June 30, 2005, we provided our payment processing services to approximately 101,500 active merchants located across the United States. In 2002, 2003 and 2004, our processing volume was $14.4 billion, $17.9 billion and $25.0 billion, respectively. Our processing volume for the six months ended June 30, 2005 was $15.4 billion, a 36.3% increase from the $11.3 billion processed during the same period in 2004. Our revenue is recurring in nature as we typically enter into three-year service contracts that, in order to qualify for the agreed-upon pricing, require the merchant to achieve processing volume minimums. Most of our gross revenue is payment processing fees, which are a combination of a percentage of the dollar amount of each Visa and MasterCard transaction we process plus a flat fee per transaction. On average, our gross revenue from processing transactions equals approximately $2.38 for every $100 we process. We sell and market our payment processing services through a nationwide direct sales force of approximately 800 sales professionals, known as Relationship Managers. Our sales force is responsible for both the initial sale to, and the ongoing relationship management with, our merchants. Our sales force is compensated solely with commissions, which are directly tied to the performance of the contract signed by the merchant. They are therefore compensated only for adding and retaining profitable processing volume. In 2004, our sales force generated over 42,500 merchant applications and installed over 39,000 new merchants. We focus our sales efforts on low-risk merchants and have developed systems and procedures designed to minimize our exposure to potential losses. In 2002, 2003 and 2004, we experienced losses of $0.6 million, $0.6 million and $0.9 million, respectively, each of which represented less than 0.4 basis points (0.004%) of payment processing volume. In the first quarter of 2005, we experienced losses of $0.3 million, or 0.44 basis points. We cannot predict our future losses, and any future increases in the loss rate would reduce our income. We have developed expertise in industries that we believe present relatively low risks, as the customers are generally present and the products or services are generally delivered at the time the transaction is processed. These industries include restaurants, brick and mortar retailers, lodging establishments (hotels and motels), automotive repair shops, convenience and liquor stores and professional service providers. As of March 31, 2005, over 33% of our merchants were restaurants. We believe that restaurants represent an attractive merchant base as they typically have unique processing needs and have significant, predictable processing volume. Our direct sales force and merchant services initiatives are supported by our technology platform. We use a number of proprietary Internet-based systems which allow us to increase our operating efficiencies and distribute our processing and merchant data to our three main constituencies: our sales force, our merchant base and our customer service staff. In 2001, we began using our internally-developed system, HPS Exchange, to provide authorization and data capture services, known as front-end processing, to our merchants. We believe that our proprietary systems provide a superior experience for both our Relationship Managers and merchants, which enhances the overall relationship. We also believe that our front-end processing system allows us to offer superior service at a lower cost to us. During the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2004, and the quarter ended March 31, 2005, approximately 26%, 43% and 51% respectively, of our transactions were processed through HPS Exchange, and we anticipate that as this percentage increases our processing costs per transaction will continue to decline. We rely on third parties, primarily Vital Processing Services, Inc., to provide the remainder of our bank card authorization and data capture services, as well as all of our settlement and merchant accounting services. Since 2002, our processing volume has increased 31.8% annually from approximately $14.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2002 to approximately $25.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2004. During the same period, our total net revenues increased from $340.6 million in 2002 to $602.7 million in 2004. We have achieved this growth entirely through internal expansion rather than through acquisitions or buying merchant contracts from others. In 2000 and 2001 we recorded net losses of $9.4 million and $17.4 million, respectively. In 2002, 2003 and 2004, we recorded net income of $4.9 million, $20.1 million and $8.9 million, respectively. In 2004, our net income declined approximately 55.7% from 2003 primarily as the result of income tax benefits recorded in 2003.

The online healthcare information, decision-support applications and communications services that we provide: • enable consumers to obtain detailed information on a particular disease or condition, analyze symptoms, locate physicians, store individual healthcare information, receive periodic e-newsletters on topics of individual interest, enroll in interactive courses and participate in online communities with peers and experts; • make it easier for physicians and healthcare professionals to access clinical reference sources, stay abreast of the latest clinical information, learn about new treatment options, earn continuing medical education credits and communicate with peers; and • enable employers and health plans to provide their employees and plan members with access to personalized health and benefit information and decision-support technology that helps them make more informed benefit, provider and treatment choices. WebMD Health, our primary public portal for consumers, and our other consumer portals, help consumers take an active role in managing their health by providing objective healthcare and lifestyle information. WebMD Health’s content offerings include access to health and wellness news articles and features, and decision-support services that help consumers make better informed decisions about treatment options, health risks and healthcare providers. Medscape from WebMD, our primary public portal for physicians and healthcare professionals, helps physicians and healthcare professionals improve their clinical knowledge and practice of medicine. Its original content, including daily medical news, commentary, conference coverage, expert columns and continuing medical education, or CME, activities are written by authors from widely respected academic institutions and edited and managed by our in-house editorial staff. The WebMD Health Network consists of the public portals that we own, such as www.WebMD.com and www.Medscape.com, as well as third party sites through which we provide our branded health and wellness content, tools and services, such as the America Online service. The WebMD Health Network had an average of approximately 24 million aggregate unique users per month and generated approximately 1.2 billion aggregate page views in the first half of 2005. The WebMD Health Network does not include our private portals for employers and health plans, which are described below. We believe that our ability to create, source, edit and organize online health-related content and interactive services has made The WebMD Health Network the leading online health destination, based on the total number of unique users, and has made the WebMD brand among the most recognized in healthcare. According to recent studies, some of which were prepared at our request for a fee, by Manhattan Research, LLC, a leading Internet market research firm, WebMD is the information source most frequently recommended by physicians to their patients for healthcare information. Our public portals generate revenue primarily through the sale of advertising and sponsorship products, including CME services. We do not charge user fees for access to our public portals. The WebMD Health Network enables sponsors to reach, educate and inform target audiences of health-involved consumers and clinically-active physicians. We work closely with our sponsors to develop programs to reach specific groups of consumers, physicians and healthcare professionals and give them placement on the most relevant areas on our portals. Our advertisers and sponsors consist primarily of pharmaceutical, biotechnology and medical device companies and consumer products companies whose products relate to health, wellness, diet, fitness, lifestyle, safety and illness prevention. Our private portals enable employees and health plan members to make more informed benefit, treatment and provider decisions. We provide a personalized user experience by integrating individual user data (including personal health information), plan-specific data from our employer or health plan clients and much of the content, decision-support technology and personal communication services that we make available through our public portals. We generate revenue from private portals through the licensing of our content and technology to employers, such as American Airlines, Inc., Microsoft Corporation and PepsiCo, Inc., and to health plans, such as Cigna and Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield. Our private portals do not generate revenue from advertising or sponsorship and, accordingly, we do not include users or page views from these portals in The WebMD Health Network.

We offer a broad spectrum of products ranging from business cards and brochures to invitations and holiday cards. We seek to offer compelling value to our customers through an innovative use of technology, a broad selection of customized printed products, low pricing and personalized customer service. Through our use of proprietary Internet-based graphic design software, 16 localized websites, proprietary order receiving and processing technologies and advanced computer integrated printing facilities, we offer a meaningful economic advantage relative to traditional graphic design and printing methods. We believe that our value proposition has allowed us to successfully penetrate the large, fragmented, geographically dispersed and underserved small business and consumer markets. We have standardized, automated and integrated the entire graphic design and print process, from design conceptualization to product shipment. Customers visiting our websites can use our graphic design software to easily create and order full-color, personalized, professional-looking printed products, without any prior graphic design training or experience. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2005, customers used our design technologies to regularly place over 10,000 customized orders per day, at average order values of approximately $30, with an aggregate cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue of less than 45%. Our proprietary, Internet-based order processing systems receive and store thousands of individual print jobs on a daily basis and, using complex algorithms, efficiently aggregate multiple individual print jobs for printing as a single press-run. By combining this order aggregation technology with our computer integrated print manufacturing facilities, we are able to significantly reduce the costs and inefficiencies associated with traditional short run printing and can provide customized finished products in as few as three days from design to delivery. ------ VistaPrint Limited is incorporated under the laws of Bermuda.

Our services include local and long distance voice services, broadband Internet access, email, voicemail, web hosting, secure backup and file sharing and virtual private network. Our voice services are delivered using Voice over Internet Protocol, or VoIP, technology, and all of our services are delivered over our secure all-Internet Protocol, or IP, network. We provide quality of service and achieve network and call reliability comparable to that of traditional phone networks while incurring significantly lower capital expenditures and operating costs. We believe our all-IP network platform enables us to deliver an integrated bundle of communications services that may otherwise be unaffordable or impractical for our customers to obtain. We first launched our service in Atlanta in April 2001 and now also operate in Dallas, Denver, Houston and Chicago. As of June 30, 2005, we were providing communications services to 17,435 customer locations. We believe that the attractive value proposition of our integrated bundled communications service offering and our ability to successfully replicate our business model in new markets have enabled us to achieve significant growth. Primarily driven by our growth in new customers, our revenues grew from $65.5 million in 2003 to $113.3 million in 2004 and $73.4 million in the first six months of 2005. Our net operating losses have decreased over this same period, from $25.7 million in 2003 to $7.3 million in 2004 and $1.4 million in the first six months of 2005. Our IP/VoIP Network Architecture. We deliver our services over a single, private all-IP network using only a high speed T-1 connection, or multiple T-1 connections, rather than the public Internet, which is employed by other VoIP companies such as Vonage and Skype Technologies. Our network allows us to provide a wide array of voice and data services, attractive service features (such as real-time online additions and changes), quality of service and network and call reliability comparable to that of traditional telephone networks. We believe our network requires significantly lower capital expenditures and operating costs compared to traditional service providers using legacy circuit-switched technologies, which require separate networks to provide voice and data services. Our Target Market and Value Proposition. Our target market is businesses with 4 to 200 employees in large metropolitan cities, using five or more phone lines. According to 2005 Dun & Bradstreet data, there are approximately 1.4 million businesses with 5 to 249 employees in the 25 largest markets in the United States. We are currently in five of these markets and plan to launch service in six additional markets by the end of 2009. We provide integrated packages of managed services at competitively priced, flat monthly fees under fixed-length contracts. We also offer our customers a range of enhanced services for additional fees. Our target customers generally do not have dedicated in-house resources to address their communications requirements fully. Our service offerings allow these customers access to advanced communications services without having to develop their own internal expertise. Our primary competitors, the traditional local telephone companies, do not generally offer packages of similar managed services to our target market. We believe that our value proposition, along with our fixed-length contracts, have contributed to our low historical monthly customer churn rate. We calculate our monthly customer churn rate by dividing the number of customers who discontinue service with us during a month by the total number of customers at the beginning of that month. Churn rate is a significant statistic for communications service providers, which compete for other providers’ customers. Our current customer churn rate may not be indicative of future rates because the initial term for most of our customer contracts has not yet expired. ------- Our principal executive offices are located at 320 Interstate North Parkway, Suite 300, Atlanta, Georgia 30339.

We utilize the Internet to link automotive dealers with banks, finance companies, credit unions and other financing sources, and other service and information providers, such as the major credit reporting agencies. We have established a network of active relationships with over 21,000 automotive dealers, including over 80% of all franchised dealers; over 175 financing sources, including the 20 largest independent financing sources in the United States and eight captive financing sources; and a number of other service and information providers to the automotive retail industry. Our credit application processing product enables dealers to automate and accelerate the indirect automotive financing process by increasing the speed of communications between these dealers and their financing sources. We have leveraged our leading market position in credit application processing to address other inefficiencies in the automotive retail industry value chain. Our proven network of over 21,000 dealers provides a competitive advantage for distribution of our on-demand software and data solutions. Our integrated subscription-based software products and services enable our automotive dealer customers to receive valuable consumer leads, compare various financing and leasing options and programs, sell insurance and other aftermarket products, document compliance with certain laws and execute financing contracts electronically. In addition, we offer data and other products and services to various industry participants, including lease residual value and automobile configuration data. Traditionally, the workflow processes in each stage of the automotive retail industry value chain have been manual and paper intensive and/or performed on stand-alone legacy systems, resulting in inefficiencies. In contrast to most dealer legacy systems, our web-based solutions are open and flexible, and easily integrate with other widely used software systems. Our network improves efficiency and reduces processing time for both dealers and financing sources, and integrates other information and service providers' products and services, such as credit reporting agencies. In addition, we intend to aggregate automotive industry information and introduce products and services that report the aggregated information to dealers, financing sources and other industry participants. We primarily generate revenue on both a transaction and subscription basis. We began our principal business operations in February 2001 with the introduction of our credit application processing product to address inefficiencies in the automotive financing process. Since then, we have substantially increased the number of participants in our network and have introduced new products and services through our internal product development efforts as well as through acquisitions. As a result, we have increased our total addressable market by enhancing our offering of subscription products and our data and reporting capabilities, and expanding our network of relationships. We have grown, and believe we will continue to grow, our revenue significantly faster than our costs and expenses, which generates operating leverage. For example, our revenue increased $31.3 million, or 81%, to $70.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 from $38.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2003.

We were selected by Forbes as ""Best of the Web, Favorite Options Site"" in 2004, by Barron's as ""Best Online Broker"" in 2003 and 2004, and by SmartMoney as ""Best Discount Broker"" in 2004. For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2004, we experienced growth of 120.3% in revenue and 126.8% in pre-tax income compared to the nine-month period ended September 30, 2003. Our brokerage platform reflects the combination of our advanced technology and highly-responsive customer service. Our innovative browser-based technology delivers an array of differentiating trading tools, allowing both retail and professional investors to identify, analyze and execute a wide range of investment strategies. Many of these internally developed tools, which enhance our customers' experience, are not available from other online or full service brokers. In addition, our real-time customer service approach, featuring what we call ""point of contact resolution"" designed to ensure that customer questions are answered quickly and during the initial contact, yields a high degree of customer satisfaction and loyalty. We opened our first customer account in December 2000. Since that time, we have grown to over 100,000 customer accounts. Our option trades represented approximately 3% of all listed U.S. options volume for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004. We believe this makes us one of the largest retail online options brokers. Our revenue consists primarily of commissions from customers' trades of options, stocks, mutual funds and fixed-income products. For the nine months ended September 30, 2004 and the three months ended December 31, 2004, our daily average revenue trades, which are our total revenue-generating trades for a period divided by the number of trading days in that period, were approximately 13,100 and 15,100, respectively, compared to approximately 6,700 and 10,500 for the nine months ended September 30, 2003 and the three months ended December 31, 2003, respectively. Option trades represent approximately 79% of our customers' trades, with approximately 20% coming from stocks and 1% from mutual funds and fixed-income products. Our business generates strong cash flows and wide margins compared to many of our competitors. Our expense structure is largely variable based on commissions generated and benefits from our relatively low account acquisition cost and loyal customer base. In addition, all of our tools and services are offered online, eliminating the cost of maintaining retail locations. The option trading portion of our business generates a recurring revenue stream because when options expire, investors need to acquire new positions if they wish to stay invested. We have experienced growth in revenue and market share every year since inception and have been net income and cash flow positive since the first quarter of 2002.

We offer detailed traffic information, including specific speeds, travel times and delay times. We are able to provide this information by combining traffic incident and event information collected using traditional methods, such as helicopters, video cameras, mobile units and emergency scanners, with comprehensive traffic flow data collected through a large network of roadside traffic sensors. We have built a sophisticated data management system that allows us to process information in real time and deliver customized reports to large numbers of radio, television, Internet, wireless, and in-vehicle navigation system users. Currently, we provide traffic information for 35 of the largest metropolitan areas in the United States, covering approximately 64 million commuters, in such cities as Boston, Chicago, Houston, Los Angeles, New York, Philadelphia, San Diego and San Francisco. Our business model to date has been the syndicated content model traditionally used in the radio and television advertising industries. Under this model, we provide our traffic information to radio and television stations in exchange for the right to sell a specified amount of advertising time, generally adjacent to these stations' traffic reports. We then sell this advertising time to national, regional and local advertisers and retain the revenue from these sales. We recently expanded our business model to include revenue generation from several sources other than traditional radio and television. In the first quarter of 2004, we began to provide our traffic data to commercial customers for use in satellite radio, in-vehicle navigation systems and other products and services. In July 2005, we launched our enhanced www.traffic.com website and began to offer Internet advertising opportunities to our advertising customers, both on our website and on our media customers' websites. In July 2005, we also launched a consumer subscription wireless service, available through our own and our customers' websites, which as of January 14, 2006, we converted to a free service. We also began to offer wireless advertising opportunities in connection with these services. In 2004, revenue from recently introduced traffic data services provided to commercial customers amounted to $1.4 million, or 3.3% of our total 2004 revenue. For the nine months ended September 30, 2005, revenue from commercial traffic data services amounted to $1.8 million, or 5.6% of our total revenue. Revenue from Internet advertising and consumer subscriptions to date has been minimal. Our Response to Significant Trends Our business is at the intersection of three significant trends: º Traffic is bad and getting worse, costing people more in both time and money. º Advances in new interactive technology give consumers many choices for the delivery of highly personalized, on-demand traffic information over a number of devices including cell phones, personal digital assistants, or PDAs, handheld and in-vehicle navigation devices, and satellite radio receivers. º Rapid growth in advertising on the Internet has been driven by advertisers' desire to gain broader exposure in their media campaigns than has been traditionally possible through only radio and television. We believe that we are in a unique position to capitalize on these trends with our technology-driven approach to traffic data collection and our ability to attach targeted advertising messages to our traffic reports and deliver them across multiple media formats. We also believe that having broad, cross-media delivery capability, combined with the fact that our users can be targeted based on the nature and times of their travel patterns, makes our suite of traffic services attractive to advertisers. --------- We were incorporated in Delaware on October 23, 1998.

Our online business optimization software, which we host and deliver to our customers on-demand, consists of SiteCatalyst, our flagship service, and our Omniture DataWarehouse, Omniture Discover and Omniture SearchCenter services. These services enable our customers to capture, store and analyze real-time and historical information generated by their websites and other sources and to gain critical business insights into the performance and efficiency of marketing and sales initiatives and other business processes. We market our on-demand services to online businesses across a broad range of industries, including automotive, financial services, media, technology and travel. We currently have over 1,000 customers, including America Online, Apple Computer, eBay, Expedia, Ford, Gannett, Hewlett-Packard, Major League Baseball and Microsoft. In 2005, our on-demand services captured data from over 650 billion page views for our customers. The Internet has redefined many business processes and has created opportunities for new online marketing and other commercial initiatives. To make informed decisions about priorities and investments in these initiatives, businesses require timely and accurate measurement of customer behavior. Although businesses have begun to realize the benefit of using the information gained from online customer interactions to improve a broad range of business functions, the increasing scale and dynamic nature of both online business and offline business influenced by online interaction necessitate that businesses automate the processes by which they capture, analyze and act upon information generated by their websites. Measuring online behavior and automating the capture and analysis of data are just the beginning of making more informed business decisions. Businesses also need to optimize the results of their online business activities, which have become increasingly complex with the emergence of multi-channel marketing initiatives. Multi-channel marketing initiatives that combine traditional offline marketing initiatives, such as television, print and radio, with online marketing initiatives, such as search advertising, e-mail and affiliate marketing, make the measurement and analysis of online behavior more challenging, but present additional opportunities to optimize results. Businesses have generally relied on a combination of manual processes, point tools and proprietary approaches to manage their online business initiatives. These approaches, however, have a number of critical limitations, including an inability to provide businesses an aggregated view of customer information, limited scalability, limited integration with enterprise systems and lengthy and costly implementation cycles. We believe that businesses seeking to enhance their online presence need online business optimization services with the functionality, scalability and flexibility to manage and improve important aspects of their business activities. Our online business optimization services enable customers to manage and enhance their online, offline and multi-channel business initiatives. Key benefits of our services include: • Increased sales and profitability. Our services enable customers to capture and measure user activity on their websites and automate business processes to enhance the efficiency of multi-channel marketing and e-commerce initiatives. By utilizing our services, customers are able to identify trends in customer behavior in real time, to direct business expenditures towards initiatives that they believe will increase sales, maximize profitability and enhance customer service and thereby to gain a competitive advantage. • Flexible platform to manage online business. Our services are based on a technology platform that manages online business data from a centralized information store. Our multi-tenant technology platform is based upon a massively scalable computing architecture that allows us to share common computing resources simultaneously across our customer base while maintaining the integrity and security of each customer’s data. Our technology is built on a standards-based platform, which allows for interoperability with other third-party and proprietary systems. • Enterprise-class scalability, performance, security and support. Our platform is designed to scale to meet the needs of the largest and most sophisticated online operations in the world. Our customers rely on us to capture and manage significant volumes of data securely and accurately while providing immediate application availability and flexible real-time reporting. We currently capture over 3 billion page views per day and manage over 600 terabytes of data for our customers. We provide our customers with comprehensive onsite implementation, training and support services, including best practices consulting and training through Omniture University. • Independent, unaffiliated service provider. Our platform interfaces with major Internet search vendors, advertising networks, e-mail marketers and lead generation sites and consolidates information across those channels into a single unified view. However, we are unaffiliated with any particular marketing channel or service provider and therefore can provide reliable and secure information that is independent. As such, we provide our customers with objective insight into the effectiveness of their multi-channel marketing expenditures across multiple channels, Internet vendors and partners. • Reduced capital investment through on-demand hosted model. We deliver our services entirely through an on-demand, hosted model. Our on-demand model enables our customers to calibrate their expenditures to their required level of service. As a result, our customers are able to limit their upfront investments in technology infrastructure, third-party software and systems, and more effectively leverage their own IT personnel. ------ We were founded in 1996, began offering our on-demand online business optimization services in 1997 and began selling these services to enterprises in 2001.

Historically, computing within an organization across wide area networks (WANs) has been plagued by poor performance, IT complexity and high cost. Our Steelhead® appliances enable our customers to improve the performance of their applications and access to their data across WANs, typically increasing transmission speeds by 5 to 50 times and in some cases up to 100 times. Our products also offer the ability to simplify IT infrastructure and realize significant capital and operational cost savings. Our goal is to establish our solution as the preeminent performance and efficiency standard for organizations relying on wide-area distributed computing. We believe that our products and services can provide significant benefits in millions of locations worldwide. We refer to Wide-area Data Services (WDS) as the market for providing global access to data and applications across WANs with local area network (LAN)-like performance. Unlike alternative approaches, our WDS products and services simultaneously address, across a broad range of applications, the inter-related root causes of poor performance of wide-area distributed computing: application protocol inefficiencies, network protocol inefficiencies and insufficient bandwidth. Our Steelhead line of appliances utilizes our proprietary software to deliver significant benefits to our customers, including the ability to: † accelerate performance of applications and access to data over the WAN; † consolidate geographically distributed IT resources; † reduce the need for WAN bandwidth; † shorten storage back-up and replication time over the WAN; † provide local storage for continued access to remote files during WAN failures; and † improve productivity and reduce frustration for IT managers and end-users. Our products are designed to be deployed more easily and transparently into our customers’ networks than alternative products. Our products are also more easily managed, are scalable across networks of all sizes and address the wide-area distributed computing needs of every major industry.

We develop, market and sell a unified suite of data management software applications under the QiNetix (pronounced “kinetics”) brand. QiNetix is specifically designed to protect and manage data throughout its lifecycle in less time, at lower cost and with fewer resources than alternative solutions. QiNetix provides our customers with: • high-performance data protection, including backup and recovery; • disaster recovery of data; • data migration and archiving; • global availability of data; • replication of data; • creation and management of copies of stored data; • storage resource discovery (the automated recognition of available storage resources allowing more efficient storage and management of data) and usage tracking (tracking the use of available storage resources); • data classification (the creation and tracking of key data attributes to enable intelligent, automated policy-based data movement and management); and • management and operational reports and troubleshooting tools. We also provide our customers with a broad range of highly effective professional services that are delivered by our worldwide support and field operations. QiNetix addresses the markets for backup and recovery, replication, archival and storage management, offering our customers high-performance and comprehensive solutions for data protection, business continuance, corporate compliance and centralized management and reporting. QiNetix enables our customers to simply and cost-effectively protect and manage their enterprise data throughout its lifecycle, from data center to remote office, covering the leading operating systems, relational databases and applications. In addition to addressing today’s data management challenges, our customers can realize lower capital costs through more efficient use of their enterprise-wide storage infrastructure assets, including the automated movement of data from higher cost to lower cost storage devices throughout its lifecycle and through sharing and better utilization of storage resources across the enterprise. QiNetix can also provide our customers with reduced operating costs through a variety of features, including fast application deployment, reduced training time, lower cost of storage media consumables, proactive monitoring and analysis, simplified troubleshooting and lower administrative costs. QiNetix is built upon a new innovative architecture and a single underlying code base, which we refer to as our Common Technology Engine. This unified architectural design is unique and differentiates us from our competitors, some of which offer similar applications built upon disparate software architectures, which we refer to as point products. We believe our architectural design provides us with significant competitive advantages, including offering the industry’s most granular and automated management of data, tiered classification of all data based on its user-defined value and greater product reliability and ease of installation. In addition, we believe we have lower support and development costs and faster time to market for our new data management software applications. QiNetix fully interoperates with a wide variety of operating systems, applications, network devices and protocols, storage arrays (methods for storing information on multiple devices), storage formats and tiered storage infrastructures (storage environments in which data is organized and stored on a variety of storage media based on size, age, frequency of access or other factors), providing our customers with the flexibility to purchase and deploy a combination of hardware and software from different vendors. As a result, our customers can purchase and use the optimal hardware and software for their needs, rather than being restricted to the offerings of a single vendor. We have established a worldwide multi-channel distribution network to sell our software and services to large global enterprises, small and medium sized businesses and government agencies, both directly through our sales force and indirectly through our global network of value-added resellers, system integrators, corporate resellers and original equipment manufacturers. As of June 30, 2006, we had licensed our data management software to approximately 4,300 registered customers across a variety of industries.

At the end of 1998, we were the sixth largest provider of emailboxes in the world, according to numbers compiled by ELECTRONIC MAIL & MESSAGING SYSTEMS for its quarterly emailbox census. Our basic email services are free to our members. We generate revenues primarily from advertising related sales, including direct marketing and e-commerce promotion. We also generate revenue from subscription services, such as premium email addresses and increased storage capacity, and from email service outsourcing fees. In April 1999, we delivered over 90 million email messages to our members and delivered approximately 190 million advertisements. INDUSTRY BACKGROUND Use of the Internet and Internet related applications is growing rapidly. The International Data Corporation (IDC) projects that the number of Web users will increase from 142 million worldwide at the end of 1998 to 502 million by the end of 2003. GROWTH OF EMAIL Email is becoming an increasingly important means of communication, with both the number of email users and usage levels per individual projected to increase significantly. Email has the highest usage of any service on the Internet. In an October 1998 Jupiter Communications/NFO Interactive survey, approximately 93% of respondents reported using email regularly. According to the Jupiter/ NFO survey, there are over three times as many online users who regularly use email as there are viewing or creating a personal homepage, visiting a sports, music or games related site, or participating in online chat. At the end of 1998, there were approximately 325 million emailboxes worldwide, an increase of 64% from a year before according to a study by ELECTRONIC MAIL & MESSAGING SYSTEMS. Forrester Research projects that daily global Internet email traffic will increase from 100 million messages per day in 1996 to 1.5 billion messages per day in 2002. We believe the growth in email usage reflects several advantages over traditional methods of communication. An email is easier to send than printed correspondence and typically arrives in minutes. Email is easily distributed and forwarded to many recipients or distributed to mailing lists. The electronic format of email offers electronic filing, searching and editing capabilities not generally available for faxes, voicemail and other forms of communications. Email also allows for computer file attachments, permitting the recipient to open and use files if they have the appropriate application software. In addition, email can be integrated with other applications such as automated scheduling, document sharing, and messaging applications such as email-to-fax and email-to-pager. We believe that Webmail accounts are a rapidly growing category of emailboxes. According to ELECTRONIC MAIL & MESSAGING SYSTEMS, the number of Webmail accounts increased from 2.4 million at the end of 1996 to 82.7 million at the end of 1998. Webmail allows users to access their email through any computer or other device that has a Web browser and access to the Internet. The feature email users request most is universal access to their email services, according to a survey conducted by Jupiter Communications/NFO Interactive. EMERGENCE OF THIRD PARTY EMAIL SERVICE PROVIDERS The email industry is highly fragmented with large numbers of ISPs, businesses and schools maintaining their own systems. We believe that as the complexity and usage of email increases there will be an increasing desire on the part of Web sites, ISPs, small businesses and educational institutions to outsource their email to third parties. We believe our economies of scale, flexible technology platform and email focus will enable us to offer these market segments an attractive outsourcing alternative, both domestically and internationally. Prior to 1996, nearly all email services were provided directly by users' employers, schools or ISPs. The emergence of Webmail has given third party providers the ability to provide email services to any user with access to the Web. This permits the development of large third-party email providers that often have economy of scale advantages over traditional email providers, including: - the ability to spread costs of developing specialized email products and services over large numbers of users; - the ability to service many customer locations from one or more large centralized data centers; - sufficient global traffic to warrant 24 hour customer support and system maintenance staff; - volume purchasing of hardware, software, telecommunications and other services; - sufficient user base to attract general interest advertisers as well as specialized advertisers seeking users in specific demographic targets; and - sufficient user base to develop direct marketing and e-commerce opportunities. ADVERTISING, DIRECT MARKETING AND E-COMMERCE ON THE INTERNET The Web is emerging as an attractive new medium for advertisers, offering the ability to target advertising more effectively than many traditional media. Jupiter Communications projects that the amount of advertising dollars spent on the Internet is expected to increase from approximately $1.9 billion in 1998 to $7.7 billion by 2002, a compound annual growth rate of 42%. By advertising on the Web, advertisers have the ability to target their messages to specific groups of consumers. The Web also allows advertisers to measure the number of times that a particular advertisement has been presented and the responses to the advertisement. We also believe that the Web improves advertisers' direct marketing efforts, which have been traditionally conducted through direct mail and telemarketing. The interactive nature of the Web gives advertisers the potential to establish dialogues and one-to-one relationships with potential consumers. Advertisers can then make highly targeted product offers to consumers at the point of sale over the Web at lower costs. We believe that the growth in Web users and usage and the increasing potential for e-commerce will continue to create growth in Web advertising and direct marketing. The Web is becoming a vehicle for e-commerce, since online purchases of goods and services can be less expensive and more convenient than traditional transactions. We believe that as the volume of e-commerce transactions expands, retailers will offer a greater variety of products and services over the Web. Forrester Research has estimated that online sales for retail goods other than automobiles totaled $4.8 billion in 1998 and projects that these sales will increase to $50.2 billion in 2002.

Upon completion of this offering, we will have long-term exhibitor services agreements with our founding members-AMC, Cinemark and Regal, the three largest motion picture exhibition companies in the U.S.-and multi-year agreements with several other theatre operators whom we refer to as network affiliates. The exhibitor services agreements grant us exclusive rights, subject to limited exceptions, to sell advertising and meeting services and distribute entertainment programming in those theatres. The network affiliate agreements grant us exclusive rights, subject to limited exceptions, to sell advertising on their theatre screens. We currently derive revenue principally from the following activities: • Advertising: We develop, produce, sell and distribute a branded, pre-feature entertainment and advertising program called ""FirstLook,"" along with an advertising program for our lobby entertainment network and various marketing and promotional products in theatre lobbies; • CineMeetings: We facilitate live and pre-recorded networked and single-site meetings and corporate events in the movie theatres throughout our network; and • Digital Programming Events (now known as NCM Fathom): We distribute live and pre-recorded concerts, sporting events and other entertainment programming content to theatres across our digital network. We believe that the reach, scope and digital delivery capability of our network provide an effective platform for national, regional and local advertisers to reach a young, affluent and engaged audience on a highly targeted and measurable basis. Our network is currently located in 46 states and the District of Columbia and covers all of the top 25, as well as 49 of the top 50, Designated Market Areas®, or DMAs®, and 149 DMAs® in total. DMA ® is a registered trademark of Nielsen Media Research, Inc. During 2005, approximately 500 million patrons, representing 36% of the total U.S. theatre attendance, attended movies shown in theatres owned by our founding members. As of September 28, 2006, we had a total of 12,973 screens in our network, as set forth in the table below: Our Network* (as of September 28, 2006) Theatres Screens Digital Total Founding Members 946 10,816 12,039 Network Affiliates 87 261 934 Total 1,033 11,077 12,973 * Excludes Loews Cineplex Entertainment Inc. and Century Theatres, Inc. On January 26, 2006, AMC acquired the Loews theatre circuit. As of September 28, 2006, Loews operated approximately 107 theatres with 1,275 screens. The Loews screens will become part of our network on an exclusive basis beginning on June 1, 2008, subject to the run-out of certain pre-existing contractual obligations for on-screen advertising existing on May 31, 2008. During 2005, approximately 66.5 million movie patrons attended Loews' theatres in the United States. On October 5, 2006, Cinemark acquired the Century theatre circuit. As of that date, Century operated 77 theatres with 1,017 screens. The Century screens were added to our network on an exclusive basis, subject to limited exceptions, in November 2006. During Century's fiscal year ended September 28, 2006, approximately 49.6 million movie patrons attended Century's theatres in the United States. Our on-screen digital pre-feature show consists of a national and regional FirstLook program, which is preceded by a local advertising presentation. The pre-feature show includes entertainment content segments commingled with advertisements and ends at or about the advertised movie show time when the film trailers begin. Our lobby entertainment network includes television and high-definition plasma screens strategically located throughout the lobbies of most of our digitally equipped theatres. As of September 28, 2006, we had 1,722 lobby screens in 670 theatres deployed across our network. In addition to the lobby entertainment network, we provide a wide variety of advertising and promotional products in our theatre lobbies such as posters, standees, product displays or sampling opportunities, and box office coupons or flyer handouts. These products can be sold individually or bundled with on-screen or lobby entertainment network advertisements. For the nine-month period ended September 28, 2006, advertising accounted for 93.3% of our total pro forma revenue. Our entertainment content segments are provided under multi-year contractual arrangements with leading media companies that we refer to as content partners. Our content partners currently include Discovery Communications, NBC Universal, Sony Pictures Entertainment, Turner Broadcasting System and Universal City Studios. Under the terms of these contracts, our content partners make available to us original content segments and make long-term commitments to buy a portion of our available advertising inventory. These multi-year contracts represented 19.9% of our pro forma total revenue for the nine months ended September 28, 2006. Our CineMeetings business facilitates live and pre-recorded networked and single-site meetings and corporate events in movie theatres. Event content can be broadcast over our digital network live or prior to the event for multi-site or single-site meetings. By bundling meetings or events with the screening of a feature film, sometimes before the film opens to the general public, our ""Meeting and a Movie"" product represents a significant point of differentiation between us and other meeting venues such as hotels. For the nine months ended September 28, 2006, CineMeetings accounted for 5.1% of our total pro forma revenue. Our digital programming events business focuses on the licensing and distribution of live and pre-recorded entertainment programming content and the sale of associated sponsorships. Our digital programming events include live and pre-recorded concerts and music events, DVD product releases, marketing events, theatrical premieres, Broadway plays, live sporting events and other special events. For the nine-month period ended September 28, 2006, digital programming events accounted for 1.6% of our total pro forma revenue. In January 2007, we branded our digital programming events business NCM Fathom. During the three and nine months ended September 28, 2006, we generated pro forma revenue, operating income and adjusted EBITDA of $73.9 million, $38.9 million and $41.8 million; and $188.1 million, $84.9 million and $93.4 million, respectively. See the notes to ""Selected Historical Financial and Operating Data"" for a discussion of the calculation of adjusted EBITDA. Our business is dependent on our success in implementing and producing revenue from the business activities governed by our exhibitor services agreements and our agreements with our network affiliates, and the operating success of the founding members and our network affiliates. If one of the exhibitor services agreements were terminated, we would not be able to provide our services in theatres covered by that agreement and our revenue would likely decline. In addition, the exhibitor services agreements and other agreements were negotiated with the founding members and may contain terms that are different than comparable agreements negotiated with unaffiliated third parties. Also, our revenue may be affected by box office attendance, which declined in each of 2003, 2004 and 2005, although it increased in the first nine months of 2006 over the first nine months of 2005. ----- We are a Delaware corporation organized on October 5, 2006, and our principal executive offices are located at 9110 E.

As a network neutral provider, we do not own or operate our own network, and, as a result, our interconnection services enable our customers to exchange network traffic through direct connections with each other or through peering connections with multiple parties. Our colocation services provide space and power for customers’ networking and computing equipment allowing those customers to avoid the costs of building and maintaining their own facilities. We provide our services through 34 facilities in 23 markets, representing the broadest network neutral footprint in North America. Our footprint includes our facility in Palo Alto, one of the first commercial Internet exchanges in the world. Our high network densities, as demonstrated by approximately 17,000 interconnections between our customers, create a network effect, which provides an incentive for our existing customers to remain within our facilities and is a differentiating factor in attracting new customers. This network effect combined with our broad geographic footprint contributes to the growth of our customer base and revenue, which we believe will also increase our operating cash flow due to the fixed nature of certain of our operating costs. Our network neutral business model is a primary differentiating factor in the market. We believe the ability to connect directly with telecommunications carriers and each other enables our customers to reduce network transit costs, to improve the performance of their services and to reduce their time to market. Our diverse customer base includes some of the world’s largest network service providers, multiple system operators, Internet service providers, online content providers and enterprises. Our North America based telecommunications carrier and Internet service provider customers include AboveNet Communications, AOL and Qwest and our international carrier customers include BT, ChungHwa Telecom, Singapore Telecommunications, Telecom Italia and VSNL. Our online content provider customers include DirecTV, Electronic Arts, Google, LimeLight Networks, Yahoo! and YouTube. Our enterprise customers include Internet dependent businesses, including Amazon.com and Factset, and other enterprises such as GlaxoSmithKline, Hewlett Packard, Microsoft and Verisign. We believe our broad geographic footprint represents a competitive advantage in that we have facilities in 14 of the 15 largest metropolitan service areas in the United States and is the broadest of any of our network neutral competitors. Our presence in these markets enables us to serve customers in locations where Internet traffic is most concentrated and to serve customers who require a broad geographic footprint. As of September 30, 2006, of our top 100 customers as measured by revenue, 73 utilize our services in multiple markets. Although we have been unable to achieve profitability, since our founding in 1998, we have increased our revenue through a combination of organic growth and acquisitions. We believe our customer base of over 830 companies as of September 30, 2006 provides a platform for organic growth. Sales to existing customers in the first nine months of 2006 comprised approximately 76% of incremental sales of our interconnection and colocation services. Since March 2003, we have completed five acquisitions and integrated 12 facilities into our operations. These acquisitions have increased our network densities, expanded our customer base and broadened our geographic footprint. Several favorable trends in our industry are driving demand for our network neutral interconnection and colocation services. These trends include growth in Internet traffic driven by, among other things, increasing broadband penetration and a proliferation of broadband intensive applications, an increasing need for advanced networking technology provided through reliable and secure infrastructure and a growing awareness of business continuity and disaster recovery planning. ----- We were incorporated on July 31, 2006 as a Delaware corporation.

As a result, many companies are redirecting their technology investments toward systems that will maximize their long-term revenue streams by increasing customer loyalty. Within industries that are characterized by complex products, services, or channel relationships, competitive advantage often results from a company's ability to provide products, services and content that are specific to the preferences of individual customers, particularly when they are making a buying decision. Companies are also realizing that existing and potential customers often access their organization through multiple business channels, including e-commerce channels, traditional direct sales forces, and indirect channel partners. It is therefore important that companies not only equip these channels with systems that provide competitive differentiation when a customer's buying decision is being made, but that they provide the customer with consistent, valuable service across all channels. In response to this shift toward customer-oriented systems, companies originally invested heavily in traditional customer relationship management, or CRM, software, which was designed to automate administrative support for traditional corporate sales, call center, and service employees to more effectively manage customer relationships. These solutions, which traditionally have included functionality such as customer contact management, sales force administration, call center service and support, and marketing automation, have helped to eliminate cost inefficiencies within a company's sales and marketing organization by streamlining and consolidating customer information and other internal administrative tasks. However, because these applications are focused on administrative aspects of a company's sales and marketing efforts, they generally have not directly enhanced the customer's buying experience. Traditional CRM solutions are further prevented from providing value directly to customers because they were typically designed before the widespread commercial use of the Internet, and were not intended for large scale, Internet-based customer-driven transactions. Many companies that implemented traditional CRM systems therefore have found themselves with systems that do not interactively engage the customer in ways that add value to those relationships or enhance individual buying decisions. The rapid evolution and acceptance of the Internet as a means for communicating, sharing information, and transacting directly with customers worldwide has dramatically changed the focus of customer relationship management. The Internet offers new opportunities for increased interactivity and self-service, enabling companies to create new approaches for initiating, developing and managing customer relationships over time. The Internet enables the creation of powerful new revenue channels, while simultaneously improving the effectiveness with which existing distribution channels market, sell and support product and service offerings. Forrester Research, Inc. estimates that the total value of U.S. business trade on the Internet will grow to approximately $1.3 trillion in 2003. International Data Corporation, or IDC, estimates that the market for Internet Commerce applications will grow 280% to $1.7 billion in 1999 and projects the market to top $13 billion by 2003. We have derived this information from Internet Commerce Software Applications Market Review and Forecast, 1998-2003, April 1999. As a result of these developments, the market for sales and marketing oriented e-business software offerings has also evolved rapidly. The first generation of e-business software was primarily focused on providing the back office infrastructure to enable secure commerce transactions. More recently, a variety of niche e-business software applications have been introduced, including Internet content management and personalization offerings, which target a specific aspect of the customer relationship or buying process. These point solutions have provided tactical value in encouraging the adoption of the Internet for the purchase of more basic, consumer-oriented goods. However, they have typically not provided the advanced, comprehensive selling functionality necessary to offer targeted products, services and content based upon a customer's individual profile or stated requirements, which we believe is a critical success factor for companies using e-commerce to sell complex products and services. In addition, these Internet applications typically do not interact with a company's traditional sales and distribution channels. Because these applications were designed to support only Internet-based interactions, they typically are unable to collect information about customers when they access a company's traditional sales channels, leaving a company with an incomplete view of an individual customer's behavior, requirements and preferences. This inability to enable a common view of individual customers across multiple selling channels limits a company's ability to develop strategies for improving its product offerings, services, and selling processes in ways that would encourage repeat business from those customers. Companies that sell complex products and services require a new generation of e-business sales and marketing applications to offer targeted products, services, and content to individual customers. Without these applications, companies with complex selling activities may not be able to execute successful e-commerce strategies, and may be forced to rely exclusively on traditional human-assisted selling channels for their revenue streams. To encourage conversion of potential customers into customers and repeat business from individual customers, these companies must utilize advanced, Internet-based technologies that offer enhanced customer interactivity and can support the creation of personalized solutions in a highly scalable and reliable fashion at the time of customer buying decisions. These capabilities must support the rapid deployment of an effective e-commerce channel for selling complex products and services, and must also automate complex selling activities within traditional direct and indirect selling channels to maximize the ability of all channels to transact new business. This next-generation software must also capitalize on the highly interactive nature of the Internet to collect real-time customer information from individual selling interactions across all sales channels, so that this common view of customer activity may be shared across a company's enterprise as a basis for developing improved product offerings, services, and selling processes that encourage long-term customer loyalty. THE FIREPOND SOLUTION FirePond is a leading provider of integrated e-business sales and marketing solutions for companies wishing to offer complex products and services through business-to-business and business-to-consumer e-commerce channels. We offer packaged software applications and related services that allow these companies to deploy comprehensive, highly interactive selling systems that increase customer conversion and retention of individual customers over the long term, in both e-commerce and more traditional sales channels. Our packaged software product, the FirePond Application Suite, allows companies in our targeted markets to offer personalized products, services and content when a customer is preparing to buy, either on an e-commerce web-site, or from a direct salesperson, distributor, dealer or agent. Using our software, companies are able to share customer information obtained from business-to-business or business-to-consumer e-commerce sales transactions with traditional sales channels, where that information is used by sales people to improve individual customer relationships and develop additional revenue opportunities. By enabling these interactive, Internet-based selling transactions, our products are able to collect from multiple selling channels real-time information about individual customer behavior, preferences and transaction activity, creating a common view of individual customers. Our software then distributes this customer information across the enterprise, where it provides the basis for developing improved product offerings, services and selling processes that will increase the likelihood of long-term customer retention. Using our integrated e-business sales and marketing solutions, companies that offer complex products and services are able to: - quickly develop an effective e-commerce sales channel by delivering interactive selling capabilities to business-to-business and business-to-consumer e-commerce sites; - automate highly complex selling tasks within direct and indirect selling channels to ensure the accuracy and personalization of products and services offered to customers throughout those channels; - utilize the same business rules, data and selling functionality across all e-commerce and traditional sales channels, so that individual customers receive consistent, high quality information when they are ready to buy products or services; - develop a common view of each customer across all e-commerce and traditional sales channels to bring intelligence and consistency to every customer interaction; - take advantage of the interactivity of the Internet to create a common view of individual customers from real-time interactions across selling channels, and share that information across the enterprise to enable strategies for improved product offerings, services, and selling processes, increasing the likelihood of achieving long-term customer loyalty; and - achieve high reliability, performance and scalability in e-commerce environments, as well as in broader enterprise environments that support multiple selling channels.

Service providers use our products to transport, convert and manage voice traffic over legacy and IP networks, while enabling voice over IP, or VoIP, and other multimedia communications services. Our IP products consist of our innovative ControlSwitch softswitch solution and I-Gate 4000 family of media gateway products. Our media gateways are used to convert traditional telephone voice traffic into IP, compress the data packets and transport this data on IP networks. Our softswitch solution manages and directs the IP traffic (such as a voice call) to its appropriate destination, whether it starts out as IP traffic or is traditional traffic that has been converted. The media gateway and ControlSwitch products work together, allowing service providers to unify and manage IP and traditional networks. This benefits service providers with mixed networks by enabling them to deliver value-added communications services, such as toll-free and pre-paid calling, to users across legacy circuit-switched and IP networks, while enabling a smooth, incremental transition to all IP networks. Intense competition in the telecommunications industry has driven service providers to seek ways to lower costs, deploy more efficient networks, offer new value-added services and enhance their competitive position. Many service providers are combining separate voice and data networks onto one converged network using IP technologies to offer VoIP and other multimedia communications services. Our products’ ability to convert traditional voice traffic to IP and back allows our customers to operate two distinct networks as a single network and thereby continue to utilize their existing wireless and wireline legacy networks while simultaneously offering next generation IP applications and services. This functionality provides our customers the flexibility to smoothly and incrementally migrate to all IP networks in a cost-effective manner while still being able to deploy advanced communications services and without compromising service quality. Our portfolio of products enables service providers to deploy flexible networks that can adapt to changing end user demands, regulatory conditions and competitive industry dynamics. Traditional voice switches are deployed in specific configurations with customized hardware and software modules. In contrast, the Veraz solution includes standards-based programmable software components that allow service providers to offer these services with less hardware build-out and cost. The Veraz solution only requires our media gateway hardware and ControlSwitch, which when combined offer great flexibility of deployments to service providers. We have developed innovative IP product solutions incorporating leading technologies that enable service providers to accomplish several objectives, including: • seamless migration of legacy networks to IP; • cost reduction; • rapid introduction of new services; • revenue growth and margin improvement; and • compatibility of existing investment with emerging standards. Our business initially was focused on the sale of digital circuit multiplication equipment, or DCME, products to service providers for use in their legacy networks. Our DCME products are communications systems that use proprietary signal processing technology to increase the effective capacity of transmission links by compressing voice and fax traffic while maintaining the quality of that traffic. We continue to sell DCME products compatible with both legacy and next generation networks, and DCME sales comprise a significant portion of our present business. We have increasingly focused our efforts on our IP products, and we have experienced rapid growth in our IP product revenues. By leveraging our large installed base of DCME customers, we believe we are well positioned to be the provider of IP network solutions to our existing customers as they migrate to IP networks. Our customers include over 400 service providers that have deployed our DCME products in over 90 countries and over 55 service providers that have deployed our IP products. A representative sample of customers include Belgacom International Carrier Services, Cable & Wireless (Panama and Jamaica), Equant, Meditelcom Inc., Moessel (Jamaica) Limited (Digicel), Multiregional Transit-Telecom (MTT), Primus Telecommunications, Inc., Telekom SA, Vimplecom and Vodacom SA.

We digitally deliver content for traditional and emerging media companies, or content providers, including businesses operating in the television, music, radio, newspaper, magazine, movie, videogame and software industries. Using Limelight’s content delivery network, or CDN, content providers are able to provide their end-users with a high-quality media experience for rich media content, including video, music, games, software and social media. As consumer demand for media content over the Internet has increased, and as enabling technologies such as broadband access to the Internet have proliferated, consumption of rich media content has become increasingly important to Internet end-users and therefore to the content providers that serve them. eMarketer estimates that at the end of 2006, nearly 60% of all Internet users regularly watched videos online, and approximately 80% are expected to do so by the end of 2010. We developed our services and architected our network specifically to meet the unique demands content providers face in delivering rich media content to large audiences of demanding Internet end-users. Our comprehensive solution delivers content providers a high-quality, highly scalable, highly reliable offering at a low cost. As of May 2007, approximately 800 customers are using Limelight Networks to deliver the high-quality media experiences that their consumers seek online. Content providers seeking to deliver rich media content to end-users via the Internet have two primary alternatives: deliver content using basic Internet connectivity or utilize a CDN. The basic Internet, which is a complex network of networks, is effective for delivering many types of content but can be ineffective for delivering rich media content with satisfactory performance. Internet protocols are designed to reliably transport data packets, but the packets can be lost or delayed in transit. When data packets are lost or delayed during the delivery of rich media content, the result is noticeable to users because playback is interrupted. This interruption causes songs to skip, videos to freeze and downloads to be slower than acceptable for demanding consumers. This lack of performance and its dramatic effect on user experience make the delivery of rich media content via the basic Internet extremely challenging. In response to this challenge, some content providers have chosen to invest significant capital to build the infrastructure of servers, storage and networks necessary to bypass, as much as possible, the public Internet. The substantial capital outlay and the development of the expertise and other technical resources required to manage such a complex infrastructure can be time-consuming and prohibitively expensive for all but the largest companies. As a result, many companies have chosen to rely on one or more CDNs for the delivery of their content. Most early CDNs were built and configured to deliver the objects typically found in basic web sites such as photos or graphics, but were not configured for the large files and large content libraries associated with today’s rich media. ----- We were formed as an Arizona limited liability company, Limelight Networks, LLC, in June 2001 and converted into a Delaware corporation, Limelight Networks, Inc., in August 2003.

Our software enables retailers and consumer products, or CP, companies to define merchandising and marketing strategies based on a scientific understanding of consumer behavior and makes actionable pricing, promotion and other merchandising and marketing recommendations to achieve their revenue, profitability and sales volume objectives. We deliver our applications by means of a software-as-a-service, or SaaS, model, which allows us to capture and analyze the most recent retailer and market-level data and enhance our software rapidly to address our customers' ever-changing merchandising and marketing needs. Our CDM software is comprised of a suite of integrated applications - DemandTec Price, DemandTec Promotion, DemandTec Markdown and DemandTec TradePoint. DemandTec Price combines price optimization functionality with price management features to enable retailers and CP companies to create multiple pricing scenarios, evaluate tradeoffs and optimize everyday prices. DemandTec Promotion enables retailers and CP companies to create and simulate multiple promotional plans based on mathematical forecasts of results. DemandTec Markdown enables retailers to optimize plans and prices for items they intend to remove from their assortments, such as end-of-season items, discontinued product lines or overstocked merchandise. DemandTec TradePoint provides retailers and their CP company trading partners a platform to automate and streamline the presentation, negotiation and reconciliation of trade promotion offers in a secure, web-based environment. Most of our DemandTec Price, DemandTec Promotion and DemandTec Markdown customers are retailers, while most of our DemandTec TradePoint customers are CP companies. Our software as a service is used by 35 retailers and over 100 CP companies worldwide. Our retail customers together accounted for 94% of our revenue in fiscal 2007. Based on annual contract value, our largest U.S.-based retail customers are Best Buy, Office Depot, Safeway, Target and Wal-Mart, our largest international-based retail customers are Casino Supermarkets and Companhia Brasileira de Distribuição, our largest CP company customers are Kraft Foods Global, Nestlé USA, Procter & Gamble and Tyson Foods, and our largest sales agency customers that broker items on behalf of CP companies are Acosta Sales and Marketing and Advantage Sales and Marketing. The retail and CP markets are large, global markets. In 2005, retail trade represented approximately 23% of worldwide gross domestic product. In 2004, the CP industry generated revenue in the United States of more than $2 trillion. Retailers and CP companies have made significant investments in information technology, or IT. For example, spending on application software by retailers alone exceeded $5.2 billion in 2005 and is expected to increase to over $8.2 billion by 2010. Our target market comprises the more than 1,500 retailers worldwide that have annual sales in excess of $500 million and the thousands of CP companies that sell to these retailers. Retailers and CP companies operate in intensely competitive environments in which consumers are becoming more discerning and less loyal. The growth of discount stores, warehouse clubs and dollar stores and the emergence of the Internet as a viable retail alternative have provided consumers with increasing alternatives when purchasing goods. Consumers are becoming more knowledgeable and, in many instances, more price sensitive. Without a scalable solution to incorporate statistical analytics, retailers and CP companies historically have made merchandising decisions based on simpler approaches such as cost-plus or competitor-matching pricing and ""one-size-fits-all"" assortments. In order to gain sustainable advantage in the competition for share of consumer wallet, retailers and CP companies must better understand and predict consumer behavior across geographic, demographic and other segments. Our CDM software enables customers to incorporate a scientific understanding of consumer demand into their merchandising and marketing decision-making processes. Key benefits of our CDM software include: • Understanding and predicting consumer behavior to make merchandising and marketing recommendations that achieve revenue, profitability and sales volume objectives. Our software enables retailers and CP companies to make daily pricing decisions, enforce pricing rules consistently, forecast sales more accurately and devise more targeted promotions based on an understanding and prediction of consumer demand. By using our software, our customers can achieve their revenue, profitability and sales volume objectives, while striking a balance with their desired price and brand images in order to enhance consumer loyalty and maximize the lifetime value of the consumer. • Incorporating scalable science into merchandising and marketing decision-making processes. We incorporate advanced econometric modeling techniques and optimization theory into scalable software that our customers use to make day-to-day merchandising and marketing decisions. Our proprietary demand models quantify consumer response at the individual store and item levels based on a variety of factors, including store location, consumer demographics, advertising, in-store displays, the availability of complementary and substitute products, seasonality, competitive activity and loyalty and marketing programs. Our optimization science uses a combination of complex algorithms to help customers determine prices, promotions and markdowns that best accomplish their objectives while complying with their business rules. • Leveraging technological advancements through a SaaS delivery model, we are able to adapt to our customers' changing business needs rapidly and to deliver results quickly. By delivering our software as a service, we are able to capture and analyze the most current retailer and market-level data to better understand the dynamic nature of consumer behavior. We intimately understand how our customers use our software to make day-to-day merchandising and marketing decisions and we are able to enhance our offerings rapidly to address our customers' evolving business needs. Our grid computing environment allows us to maximize scalability and processing capacity. Our objective is to extend our position as a leading provider of CDM software. Key elements of our strategy to achieve this objective include: • continuing to invest in our state-of-the-art scientific technology that enables our customers to determine the best merchandising and marketing plans to achieve their revenue, profitability and sales volume objectives; • developing new software and enhancing our existing software to address a broader set of consumer demand management business requirements in the retail and CP markets; • capitalizing on the convergence of merchandising and marketing by developing additional applications and analytics that provide a unified understanding of consumer behavior for both merchants and marketers; • delivering additional software to CP companies; and • broadening our customer base internationally. --- We were incorporated in Delaware in November 1999.

We deliver our application suite on demand to organizations of all sizes across all industries and geographies. Our application suite is hosted on our servers located at third-party data centers, and customers access it over the Internet using a standard web browser. We strive to delight our customers by delivering innovative solutions, a broad range of performance and talent management content, process expertise and best practices knowledge gained from serving our large and varied customer base. We have over 1,400 customers across over 60 industries, with more than two million end users in over 150 countries using our application suite in 18 languages. Our customer base has organizations with as few as three and as many as 85,000 end users, including American Airlines, Inc., American Electric Power Service Corporation, AmerisourceBergen Corporation, Kimberly-Clark Corporation, Lowe's Companies, Inc., Quintiles Transnational Corp., Sutter Health, Textron Inc., T-Mobile USA, Inc., U.S. Postal Inspection Service and Wachovia Corporation. Organizations have long sought to increase the performance of their people. However, it continues to be very difficult to implement processes and systems to effectively manage human capital throughout an organization. In addition, several key trends, including increased employee mobility, diverse and geographically-distributed workforces, demographic changes and constantly evolving business requirements, are making it even more difficult for organizations to strategically manage and optimize their people. Given these increasing challenges, organizations must take a strategic view of human resources, or HR, and adopt new processes and systems to strategically manage and optimize their people to drive business results. In particular, organizations need a performance and talent management system to: • align employee performance goals with overall organizational goals; • measure and manage employee performance against aligned goals throughout the organization; • pay employees based on their performance; • recruit talent internally and externally to fill critical gaps in the organization; • identify employee skill gaps and provide needed training for current and future job requirements; and • plan for succession in the event of employee promotions, transfers and departures. Most organizations have not implemented systematic, information technology-enabled processes to realize strategic HR. Organizations that have attempted to implement performance and talent management systems have generally tried paper-based processes, which remain the dominant approach, custom-built systems, third-party human resources management systems, or point applications designed only to address specific needs. Most of these approaches have serious shortcomings, including an inability to: achieve full participation across the organization; deliver cost-effective solutions; and provide organizations a comprehensive view of employees' skills, capabilities and performance. Our solution includes the following: • Performance Management streamlines the performance appraisal process for meaningful feedback and enables organizations to tie employee performance to business results; • Goal Management supports the process of creating, monitoring and assessing employee goals across the organization and focuses employees on shared organizational goals; • Compensation Management helps customers establish a pay-for-performance culture; • Succession Management allows customers to plan for staffing changes and assure the readiness of employee talent at all levels; • Learning and Development aligns learning activities with competency gaps and facilitates the attainment of skills required for current and future job requirements; • Recruiting Management streamlines the process of identifying, screening, selecting and hiring job applicants; • Analytics and Reporting provides visibility into key performance and talent data across the organization; • Employee Profile aggregates employee profile information across an organization; • 360-Degree Review supports the collection of performance feedback from peers, subordinates and superiors; • Employee Survey provides a fast and efficient way to gain perspective on employee engagement, satisfaction and other relevant employee data; and • Proprietary and Third-Party Content provides customers with valuable insights and information to increase the effectiveness of their performance and talent management. Key benefits of our solution include: • Core Performance Management and Goal Management to Drive Business Results. We designed our solution around our core Performance Management and Goal Management modules because we believe they serve as the foundation for other human capital management activities, such as recruiting, learning and development, compensation and succession planning. • Organically Built, Not Just Functionally Integrated, Modular Suite. We built our modules organically using the same code base so that customers can provide their employees with a common user experience, leverage common data and processes, and easily add modules over time. • Continuous Customer-Driven Development. We capture and incorporate best practices knowledge we gain from interactions with our customer base. Our customer-centric development focus, together with our on-demand model, have enabled us to release significant enhancements every month for the past six years. • Ease-of-Use Drives Adoption. Our user interface is designed to be highly intuitive, requiring limited training for end users. • Relentless User-Centric Innovation. We focus on end users across all business functions and strive to deliver business applications that are as engaging as popular consumer web applications by incorporating features and content such as real-time coaching, goal and performance review writing assistants, personal dashboards and best-practice wizards. • Highly Configurable On-Demand Application Suite. Our on-demand application suite requires no installation of software or equipment on premises, which significantly reduces the costs and risks of traditional enterprise software. Our scalable solution is highly configurable, allowing customers to tailor their deployment to reflect their identity, unique business processes, and existing forms and templates. • Broad Applicability Within Organizations of All Sizes and Industries.

We operate a rapidly growing network of websites, currently grouped into three vertical categories: automotive, travel and leisure, and home and home improvement. We currently operate 46 principal websites. Utilizing a cost-efficient, proprietary operating platform, we operate and enhance websites that attract consumers through rich content, opportunities for participation in strong online communities, and user-friendly functionality. Our websites collectively attract large audiences researching high-value or specialty products, enabling us to sell targeted advertising. We also offer certain services directly to consumers, such as new car brokering. We believe that as individuals increasingly use the Internet to pursue areas of passion, research purchases and conduct commerce, both individuals and the advertisers who seek to market to them will demand access to online media in the form of vertical websites like ours. Our websites attracted 26.7 million unique visitors in September 2007 (measured by adding the number of unique visitors to each of our websites in that month), an increase of approximately 193% from an estimated 9.1 million unique visitors in September 2006. Our network includes a major automotive e-commerce website (CarsDirect.com), a growing network of online automotive enthusiast communities, significant websites in the travel and leisure category (such as Wikitravel.org and FlyerTalk.com), and popular home and home improvement websites (including ApartmentRatings.com and DoItYourself.com). Our international audiences are rapidly expanding and accounted for approximately 22% of the monthly visitors to our websites in September 2007. In addition to our consumer Internet business, we license our content and Internet technology products and services to companies and individual website owners around the world. Our Autodata Solutions division is a supplier of licensed content and technology services to the automotive industry, serving most of the major U.S., Japanese and European automotive manufacturers. In June 2007, we purchased Jelsoft Enterprises Limited (Jelsoft), the developer of vBulletin, making us the largest licensor of proprietary community bulletin board software. We monetize visits to our e-commerce and enthusiast community websites through various advertising revenue formats, such as cost per lead, cost per thousand impressions, cost per click, cost per action, and flat fees, while our Autodata Solutions and Jelsoft divisions generate revenues in the form of licensing and service fees.

We offer proprietary curriculum and educational services created for online delivery to students in kindergarten through 12th grade, or K-12. Our mission is to maximize a child's potential by providing access to an engaging and effective education, regardless of geographic location or socio-economic background. Since our inception, we have invested more than $100 million to develop curriculum and an online learning platform that promotes mastery of core concepts and skills for students of all abilities. This learning system combines a cognitive research-based curriculum with an individualized learning approach well-suited for virtual schools and other educational applications. From fiscal year 2004 to fiscal year 2007, we increased average enrollments in the virtual public schools we serve from approximately 11,000 students to 27,000 students, representing a compound annual growth rate of approximately 35%. For the three months ended September 30, 2007, we increased average enrollments 50% to approximately 39,500, as compared to the same period in the prior year. From fiscal year 2004 to fiscal year 2007, we increased revenues from $71.4 million to $140.6 million, representing a compound annual growth rate of approximately 25%, and improved from a net loss of $7.4 million to net income of $3.9 million. For the three months ended September 30, 2007, we increased revenues to $59.4 million, representing a growth rate of 57%, as compared to the same period in the prior year. Over the same period, we increased net income to $5.7 million (excluding an income tax benefit of $7.1 million) from $4.7 million. We believe we are unique in the education industry because of our direct involvement in every component of the educational development and delivery process. Most educational content, software and service providers typically concentrate on only a portion of that process, such as publishing textbooks, managing schools or providing testing and assessment services. This traditional segmented approach has resulted in an uncoordinated and unsatisfactory education for many students. Unburdened by legacy, we have taken a holistic approach to the design of our learning system. We have developed an engaging curriculum which includes online lessons delivered over our proprietary school platform. We combine this with a rigorous system to test and assess students and processes to manage school performance and compliance. In addition, our professional development programs enable teachers to better utilize technology for instruction. Our end-to-end learning system is designed to optimize the performance of the schools we serve and enhance student academic achievement. As evidence of the benefit of our holistic approach, the virtual public schools we serve generally test near, and in some cases above, state averages on standardized achievement tests. These results have been achieved despite the enrollment of a significant number of new students each school year who have had limited exposure to our learning system prior to taking these required state tests. Students using our learning system for at least three years usually perform better on standardized tests relative to state averages than students using it for one year or less. The efficacy of our learning system has also helped us achieve high levels of customer satisfaction. According to a 2006 internal survey of parents of students enrolled in virtual public schools we serve (with an approximately 33% response rate), approximately 97% of respondents stated that they were either satisfied or very satisfied with our curriculum and 95% of respondents stated that they would recommend our curriculum to other families. We deliver our learning system to students primarily through virtual public schools. As with any public school, these schools must meet state educational standards, administer proctored exams and are subject to fiscal oversight. The fundamental difference is that students attend virtual public schools primarily over the Internet instead of traveling to a physical classroom. In their online learning environment, students receive assignments, complete lessons, and obtain instruction from certified teachers with whom they interact online, telephonically, and face-to-face. Virtual public schools provide families with a publicly funded alternative to a traditional classroom-based education when relocating or private schooling is not an option, making them the ""most public"" of schools. We offer virtual schools our proprietary curriculum, online learning platform and varying levels of academic and management services, which can range from targeted programs to complete turnkey solutions, under long-term contracts. These contracts provide the basis for a recurring revenue stream as students progress through successive grades. Additionally, without the requirement of a physical classroom, virtual schools can be scaled quickly to accommodate a large dispersed student population, and allow more capital resources to be allocated towards teaching, curriculum and technology rather than towards a physical infrastructure. Substantially all of our enrollments are served through 25 virtual public schools to which we provide full turnkey solutions and seven virtual public schools to which we provide limited management services, located in 17 states and the District of Columbia. Parents can also purchase our curriculum and online learning platform directly to facilitate or supplement their children's education. Additionally, we have piloted our curriculum in brick and mortar classrooms with promising academic results. We also believe there is additional widespread applicability for our learning system internationally. ---- We were incorporated in Delaware in December 1999.

Much like a ""mission control center,"" our ArcSight ESM platform delivers a centralized, real-time view of disparate digital alarms, alerts and status messages, which we refer to as events, across geographically dispersed and heterogeneous business and technology infrastructures. Our software correlates massive numbers of events from thousands of security point solutions, network and computing devices and applications, enabling intelligent identification, prioritization and response to external threats, insider threats and compliance and corporate policy violations. We also provide complementary software that delivers pre-packaged analytics and reports tailored to specific security and compliance initiatives, as well as appliances that streamline threat response, event log archiving and network configuration. We have designed our platform to support the increasingly complex business and technology infrastructure of our customers. As of October 31, 2007, we had sold our products to more than 400 customers across a number of industries and government agencies in the United States and internationally, including companies in the Fortune Top 5 of the aerospace and defense, energy and utilities, financial services, food production and services, healthcare, high technology, insurance, media and entertainment, retail and telecommunications industries, and more than 20 major U.S. government agencies. As enterprises and government agencies increasingly utilize an interconnected information technology and business infrastructure to enhance efficiency, exchange information and conduct business with partners, customers and suppliers, these organizations expose their infrastructure and data to heightened security risks and are subject to increasing compliance requirements. The large number of heterogeneous devices and applications in a geographically distributed corporate infrastructure generates a massive amount of event data that is challenging to monitor or analyze at an enterprise-wide scale for security vulnerabilities and compliance violations. Vendor-specific management consoles and traditional systems management tools are limited in scope or are not equipped to handle a large volume of data. In addition, organizations have difficulty identifying events that are threatening in nature because they are unable to distinguish threats from the ""white noise"" of normal event activity, to recognize risks by correlating events reported by disparate systems, to understand the context in which the events arise or to appropriately prioritize responses according to risk level or corporate policy. The need for a highly scalable, holistic and intelligent solution that can help organizations address these challenges in real-time is growing. The market for security and compliance management solutions today includes security information and event management, forensics and incident investigation, policy and compliance management and network change and configuration management. According to a report by International Data Corporation, or IDC, the security information and event management, forensics and incident investigation, and policy and compliance management markets are projected to grow, in aggregate, from $993.6 million in 2007 to $2.2 billion in 2011, representing a compound annual growth rate of 22.1%. In separate reports, IDC projects that the network change and configuration management market will grow from $157.1 million in 2007 to $372.6 million in 2011, representing a compound annual growth rate of 24.1%, and the compliance infrastructure software market, in which we also compete, will grow from $8.0 billion in 2007 to $14.7 billion in 2011, representing a compound annual growth rate of 16.7%. ---- We were incorporated in Delaware on May 3, 2000 as Wahoo Technologies, Inc.

We deliver websites, web-based IT systems, and computing as a service. Our rapid growth is the result of our commitment to serving our customers, known as Fanatical Support ® ,and our exclusive focus on hosting. Our financial success is the result of responsible financial management and our disciplined, just-in-time approach to capital investment. During 2007, we had net revenues of $362.0 million. As of March 31, 2008, we served over 31,000 business customers of all sizes with more than 39,000 servers, over 750,000 business email accounts, and more than 43,000 cloud hosting domains. To deliver on our Fanatical Support Promise to our customers, we have created a culture that encourages passionate, engaged employees who we call “Rackers.” In 2008, Fortune magazine ranked Rackspace Hosting #32 on its list of “100 Best Companies to Work For.” Hosting providers offer services to support websites, web-based IT systems, and computing. The equipment required (servers, routers, switches, firewalls, load balancers, cabinets, software, wiring, etc.) to deliver services is typically purchased and managed by the hosting provider. As a result, hosting providers reduce customers’ initial capital investment and ongoing operating costs. Hosting also reduces the complexity of deploying and managing IT systems and computing, and changes the way companies purchase these products and services. Rackspace Hosting offers a full suite of hosting services, including dedicated hosting, managed hosting, and email hosting, as well as emerging services such as platform hosting and cloud hosting. Tier1Research estimates the worldwide hosting market to be $12.3 billion in 2007, with projected annual growth of 26% from 2007 to $24.4 billion in 2010. This revenue comes from three major categories – managed hosting, dedicated hosting, and shared hosting. In 2007, Rackspace Hosting was the world’s largest hosting provider by revenue, based on Tier1Research data for these categories. Historically, our business has generated high revenue growth and has grown significantly faster than the overall hosting market. Over the past five years our net revenues have grown from $56.6 million in 2003 to $362.0 million in 2007, representing an annual growth rate of 59.0%.

For the quarter ended March 31, 2008 our net revenues were $119.6 million and our net income was $5.4 million. We are focused on two key principles. First, to be recognized as one of the world’s great service companies. Second, to generate economic returns that exceed our cost of capital. This approach has allowed us to profitably grow to our current size with only $39.6 million in equity capital raised to date, excluding proceeds from stock options exercised under our equity incentive plans.

Our principal offering, Medidata Rave, is a comprehensive platform that integrates electronic data capture, or EDC, with a clinical data management system, or CDMS, in a single solution that replaces traditional paper-based methods of capturing and managing clinical data. In addition, our on-demand, hosted technology platform facilitates rapid and cost-effective deployment of our solutions on a global basis. We have designed our Medidata Rave software to scale reliably and cost-effectively for clinical trials of all sizes and phases, including those involving substantial numbers of clinical sites and patients worldwide. We also offer applications that improve efficiencies in protocol development and trial planning, contracting and negotiation through Medidata Designer, Medidata Grants Manager and Medidata CRO Contractor. We derive a majority of our revenues from Medidata Rave application services through multi-study arrangements for a pre-determined number of studies. We also offer our application services on a single-study basis that allows customers to use our solution for a limited number of studies or to evaluate it prior to committing to multi-study arrangements. We support our solutions with comprehensive service offerings, which include global consulting, implementation, technical support and training for customers and investigators. We invest heavily in training our customers, their investigators and other third parties to configure clinical trials independently.

We believe that most people have a fundamental desire to understand who they are and from where they came, and that anyone interested in discovering, preserving and sharing their family history is a potential user of Ancestry.com. We strive to make our service valuable to individuals ranging from the most committed family historians to those taking their first steps towards satisfying their curiosity about their family stories. The foundation of our service is an extensive and unique collection of billions of historical records that we have digitized, indexed and put online over the past 12 years. We have developed efficient and proprietary systems for digitizing handwritten historical documents, and have established relationships with national, state and local government archives, historical societies, religious institutions and private collectors of historical content around the world. These digital records and documents, combined with our proprietary online search technologies and tools, enable our subscribers to research their family history, build their family trees and make meaningful discoveries about the lives of their ancestors.

We are a leading provider of network security appliances and the market leader in Unified Threat Management, or UTM. Through our products and subscription services, we provide broad, integrated and high performance protection against dynamic security threats while simplifying the IT security infrastructure for enterprises, service providers and government entities worldwide. IT security and regulatory compliance have become increasingly complex for organizations, driving continued spending on solutions despite a cautious overall IT spending environment. The increasing sophistication of hackers and the rise of new Web applications have significantly multiplied the volume, intensity and diversity of security threats. Organizations have traditionally responded to security threats by deploying numerous standalone security point products within their network, such as gateway antivirus, firewall, intrusion prevention and Web filtering devices. This approach results in management complexity and a high total cost of ownership, leading to the need for a vendor that can integrate multiple security functions onto a single platform while maintaining high performance. Through our core focus on security innovation, we have built our UTM solution to address these problems. Our solution incorporates our proprietary application-specific integrated circuits, or ASICs, hardware architecture, operating system and set of associated security and networking functions to defend against multiple categories of IT security attacks without significantly impacting network performance, all while reducing point product complexity and cost.

Vertical marketing and media are focused on matching targeted segments of visitors with groupings of clients and product offerings of probable interest to them. Vertical visitor segments are defined by factors such as life stage, life events, income, career status, and expressed intent to buy or research a particular product. This approach is in contrast to marketing and media that are focused on general consumer interests and mass market audiences. We have built a strong set of capabilities to engage Internet visitors with targeted media and to connect our marketing clients with their potential customers online. We focus on serving clients in large, information-intensive industry categories, or verticals, where relevant, targeted media and offerings help visitors make informed choices, find the products that match their needs, and thus become qualified customer prospects for our clients. Our current primary client verticals are the education and financial services industries. We also have a presence in the home services, business-to-business, or B2B, and healthcare industries. We generate revenue by delivering measurable online marketing results to our clients. These results are typically in the form of qualified leads or clicks, the outcomes of customer prospects submitting requests for information on, or to be contacted regarding, client products, or their clicking on or through to specific client offers. These qualified leads or clicks are generated from our marketing activities on our websites or on third-party websites with whom we have relationships. Clients primarily pay us for leads that they can convert into customers, typically in a call center or through other offline customer acquisition processes, or for clicks from our websites that they can convert into applications or customers on their websites. We are predominantly paid on a negotiated or market-driven “per lead” or “per click” basis. Media costs to generate qualified leads or clicks are borne by us as a cost of providing our services. Founded in 1999, we have been a pioneer in the development and application of measurable marketing on the Internet. Clients pay us for the actual opt-in actions by prospects or customers that result from our marketing activities on their behalf, versus traditional impression-based advertising and marketing models in which an advertiser pays for more general exposure to an advertisement. We have been particularly focused on developing and delivering measurable marketing results in the search engine “ecosystem”, the entry point of the Internet for most of the visitors we convert into qualified leads or clicks for our clients. We own or partner with vertical content websites that attract Internet visitors from organic search engine rankings due to the quality and relevancy of their content to search engine users. We also acquire targeted visitors for our websites through the purchase of pay-per-click, or PPC, advertisements on search engines. We complement search engine companies by building websites with content and offerings that are relevant and responsive to their searchers, and by increasing the value of the PPC search advertising they sell by matching visitors with offerings and converting them into customer prospects for our clients. ------ We incorporated in California in April 1999.

By integrating a wide range of investment solutions and services, our technology platform provides financial advisors with the flexibility to address their clients’ needs. We work with financial advisors who are independent, as well as those who are associated with small or mid-sized financial advisory firms and larger financial institutions, which we refer to as enterprise clients. We focus our technology development efforts and our sales and marketing approach on addressing financial advisors’ front-, middle- and back-office needs. We believe that our investment solutions and services allow financial advisors to be more efficient and effective in the activities critical to their businesses by facilitating client interactions, supporting and enhancing portfolio management and analysis, and enabling reliable account support and administration. Our centrally-hosted technology platform provides financial advisors with the flexibility to choose freely among a wide range of investment solutions, services, investment managers and custodians to identify those that are most appropriate for their clients. Given the flexibility of choice it provides, we refer to our technology platform as having “open architecture”. Our technology platform provides financial advisors with the following: • A series of integrated services to help them better serve their clients, including risk assessment and selection of investment strategies, asset allocation models, research and due diligence, portfolio construction, proposal generation, account rebalancing, account monitoring, overlay services, performance reporting and communication tools, as well as access to a wide range of leading third-party asset custodians; • Web-based access to a wide range of technology-enabled investment solutions, including: • separately managed accounts, which allow advisors to offer their investor clients a customized, professionally managed portfolio of securities with a personalized tax basis; • unified managed accounts, which are similar to separately managed accounts but allow the advisor to use different types of investment vehicles in one account; • advisor-directed portfolios, where advisors create, implement and maintain their own investment portfolio models to address specific client needs; and • mutual funds and portfolios of exchange-traded funds; and • Access to a broad range of investment managers and investment strategists, as well as to our internal investment management and portfolio consulting group, Portfolio Management Consultants. Portfolio Management Consultants primarily engages in consulting services aimed at providing financial advisors with additional support in addressing their clients’ needs, as well as the creation of proprietary investment solutions and products. Portfolio Management Consultants’ investment solutions and products include managed account and multi-manager portfolios, mutual fund portfolios and exchange-traded fund portfolios. A majority of our revenues are derived from fees charged as a percentage of the assets that are managed or administered on our technology platform by financial advisors. Our asset-based fees vary based on the types of investment solutions and services that financial advisors utilize. As of March 31, 2010, approximately $41 billion of investment assets for which we receive asset-based fees were managed or administered utilizing our technology platform by approximately 8,500 financial advisors in approximately 185,000 investor accounts. We also generate revenues from recurring, contractual licensing fees for providing access to our technology platform, generally from a small number of enterprise clients. Licensing fees are generally fixed for a specified contract term and are based on the level and types of investment solutions and services provided, rather than on the amount of client assets on our technology platform. As of March 31, 2010, approximately $54 billion of investment assets for which we receive licensing fees for utilizing our technology platform were serviced by approximately 5,700 financial advisors through approximately 545,000 investor accounts. For over 90% of our asset-based fee arrangements, we bill customers at the beginning of each quarter based on the market value of customer assets on our technology platform as of the end of the prior quarter, providing for a high- degree of visibility for the current quarter. Furthermore, our licensing fees are highly predictable because they are generally set in multi-year contracts, providing longer term visibility regarding a portion of our total revenues. In the year ended December 31, 2009 we had total revenues of $77.9 million, income from operations of $4.3 million, net loss of $0.9 million, adjusted EBITDA of $10.6 million, adjusted operating income of $6.1 million and adjusted net income of $2.4 million. In the three months ended March 31, 2010, we had total revenues of $21.6 million, loss from operations of $2.7 million, net loss of $2.5 million, adjusted EBITDA of $3.1 million, adjusted operating income of $1.7 million and adjusted net income of $1.2 million.

Through our primary website, www.makemytrip.com, and other technology-enhanced platforms, travelers can research, plan and book a wide range of travel services and products in India as well as overseas. Our services and products include air tickets, hotels, packages, rail tickets, bus tickets, car hire and ancillary travel requirements such as facilitating access to travel insurance. We commenced operations in 2000 and in the first five years following our inception, we focused on the non-resident Indian market in the United States, servicing mainly their need for United States-India inbound air tickets. We started our Indian business with the launch of our Indian website in September 2005. During the initial years of our operations, we invested significant capital in our infrastructure as well as in sales and marketing efforts to build our brand and gain recognition, and we recorded net losses for all our fiscal years. In fiscal year 2008, our second full fiscal year since we commenced our Indian business, we recorded a net loss of $(18.9) million. We reduced our net loss in fiscal years 2009 and 2010, recording a net loss of $(7.3) million and $(6.2) million, respectively. We also reduced our operating loss in fiscal years 2009 and 2010, recording an operating loss of $(10.6) million and $(6.0) million, respectively. Excluding the effects of employee share-based compensation costs for both fiscal years 2009 and 2010, we would have recorded an operating loss of $(10.2) million in fiscal year 2009 and an operating profit of $0.8 million in fiscal year 2010; and we would have recorded a net loss of $(6.9) million in fiscal year 2009 and a net profit of $0.6 million in fiscal year 2010. We believe the strength of our brand, quality of our services, user-friendly website experience, focus on our customers and efficacy of our marketing programs have enabled us to capture a significant share of the domestic air tickets market in India. In fiscal year 2010, 1.6 million transactions for domestic air tickets in India were booked through us, and we generated $31.1 million in revenue less service cost from our air ticketing business. We leverage our strength in air travel to grow into non-air travel and other segments of the travel industry, specifically hotels and packages. Revenue less service cost from our hotels and packages business totaled $8.0 million in fiscal year 2010 and accounted for 19.8% of our total revenue less service cost. We have designed our websites to provide our customers with a user-friendly experience. According to comScore, www.makemytrip.com was the second most visited travel website in India (after the Indian Railways’ website) in each of the years from 2007 to 2009 and had an average of over 1.7 million unique visitors per month in 2009. In fiscal year 2010, 2.0 million transactions executed through our websites accounted for approximately 94.5% of our total transactions. We have built an advanced and secure technology platform, which integrates our sales, customer service and fulfillment operations. Our technology platform is scalable and can be upgraded to handle increased traffic and complexity of products with limited additional investment. According to McKinsey, the Indian middle class is expected to grow over ten times from 50 million people in 2005 (approximately 5% of the total Indian population) to 583 million people by 2025 (approximately 41% of the total Indian population). In order to meet the requirements of this growing Indian middle class travel market where Internet penetration is relatively low, we also utilize other technology-enhanced distribution channels, including call centers and travel stores in India, as well as our travel agents’ network in India. We provide our customers with access to all major domestic full-service and low-cost airlines operating in India and all major airlines operating to and from India, over 4,000 hotels in India and a wide selection of hotels outside India, Indian Railways and several major Indian bus operators. On the other hand, we believe we are a cost-effective distribution channel for our suppliers, providing reach to a large and expanding customer base in India as well as non-resident Indians. In our air ticketing business, we generate revenue through commissions and incentive payments from airlines, service fees charged to our customers and fees from our global distribution system, or GDS, service provider. A GDS service provider facilitates the reservation and confirmation of airline tickets on its system. Travel agents typically utilize a GDS to book air tickets and receive fees for their use of such system. We currently use Amadeus GDS. In our hotels and packages business, our revenue represents the total amount paid by our customers for these travel services and products and the cost of procuring the relevant services and products are classified as service cost. We evaluate our financial performance based on revenue less service cost, which is a non-IFRS measure, as we believe that revenue less service cost reflects more accurately the value addition of the travel services that we provide to our customers. Our total revenue less service cost increased from $16.5 million in fiscal year 2008 to $40.3 million in fiscal year 2010. We believe the overall Indian travel industry will experience continued growth due to income growth in India and the increased spending by Indians on travel and recreation. According to Internet World Stats, in 2009, Internet penetration was only 7.0% in India as compared with 74.1% in the United States. We therefore believe that the Indian online travel industry is well-positioned for long-term growth and that our well-recognized brand, leadership in the online travel market in India and broad and technology-enhanced distribution channels position us well to capitalize on these growth opportunities.

We have used our extensive industry expertise to design a marketplace that streamlines the traditionally inefficient scientific products supply chain. Our marketplace solutions allow buyers of scientific products to cross-search content and purchase products from multiple suppliers with a single order. Our approach does not give priority to any particular scientific products distributor, which allows us to create an open and scalable marketplace that we believe is more attractive to both buyers and sellers. Our marketplace benefits three distinct customers: scientists, purchasing professionals and suppliers. Our solutions reduce the time scientists require to find, compare, purchase, track and manage critical laboratory items, thus allowing them to spend more time on research and testing. Our solutions allow purchasing professionals to reduce procurement costs by automating order processing, consolidating purchase orders and payments, reducing errors and providing more control and information to support enterprise purchasing policies. Our solutions serve as a more efficient sales channel that enables suppliers to expand their market reach and reduce customer acquisition and order processing costs. Since our founding in 1995, we have expended significant resources to develop our brand and assemble the most comprehensive online database of over 8,000 suppliers. Our easy-to-use, interactive database currently consists of over 550,000 scientific products. Since July 1996, tens of thousands of scientists and purchasing professionals from over 60 countries have used this database to locate supplies and products. In April 1999, we introduced our e- commerce marketplace solution to this growing community of online scientific product buyers and suppliers. We intend to capitalize on this existing user base to accelerate the utilization of our marketplace. In October 1999, we entered into agreements to be the exclusive third party provider of electronic marketplace services in the United States for a period of five years for the following suppliers: Ambion, Inc., Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Inc., BioWhittaker, a Cambrex Company, Endogen, Inc., NEN Life Science Products, Inc., PerkinElmer, Inc., Pierce Chemical Company and QIAGEN N.V. In October 1999, we also entered into agreements with Dow Chemical Company and DuPont Pharmaceuticals Company to be their exclusive third party electronic aggregator for purchases of scientific products in North America for a period of three years. The illustration below summarizes the procurement process through our online marketplace: [GRAPH] Industry Background The Scientific Products Market Based upon data from the Laboratory Products Association, a trade association for laboratory product businesses, and Strategic Directions International, an international management consulting firm specializing in analytical instruments, we estimate that the market for scientific products in 1999 will be approximately $11.8 billion in North America and $36.4 billion worldwide. These expenditures are driven, to a large extent, by increases in scientific research and development investments, which are expected to continue to grow. Every year, approximately 200,000 laboratories around the world purchase scientific products from thousands of different suppliers to facilitate research and testing activities. As the demand for scientific products grows, the need for efficient procurement processes becomes more critical. The current scientific products market is characterized by: . complex, information-intensive products; . a highly fragmented supply chain; and . a heavy concentration of manual purchasing processes consisting of printed catalogs, paper requisitions and telephone and fax orders. There are, generally, three types of scientific products: (1) highly technical specialty items used for specific research and testing applications, (2) commodity products that are used in a broad range of scientific applications, and (3) highly technical instruments and other capital equipment. Suppliers typically sell specialty scientific products and instruments directly to customers, whereas commodity products are typically sold through distributors. Limitations of the Traditional Supply Chain The traditional supply chain in the scientific products industry does not adequately address the needs of scientists, purchasing professionals or suppliers. Scientists. Because scientists are continually developing applications and testing new theories, they are typically unable to forecast many of the chemicals, supplies and equipment that they will need to conduct their research and testing. For this reason scientists often: . have immediate needs for critical items that are highly technical and have exacting criteria; . need new products that they have not purchased before; and . must purchase these items from new and different suppliers. As a result, it is difficult and time-consuming for scientists to identify, compare and purchase the scientific products required to meet their needs using the traditional approach. In fact, we estimate that a typical laboratory spends up to four hours weekly searching through paper catalogs and product literature and requesting technical data from various suppliers. Purchasing Professionals. The product ordering process traditionally has been a paper-based process that requires manual preparation of purchase orders and order tracking. Traditionally, scientists requisition supplies through purchasing professionals within their organizations who place orders with multiple suppliers by telephone, fax and e-mail. This multi-step manual process is highly susceptible to errors. Additionally, the traditional process makes it difficult for purchasing professionals to enforce purchasing policies among scientists who specify and request products. Buying organizations in a variety of industries that were surveyed by the Aberdeen Group, a computer and communications research and consulting organization, reported that it typically costs $107 per requisition for orders processed manually, compared with $30 on average to process an order through an Internet automated procurement system. Suppliers. Traditionally, suppliers have used two sales channels: traditional distributors and direct sales. While traditional distributors can give a supplier access to a broad market, distributors separate suppliers from the ultimate customer and may lack the ability to provide the technical assistance required to sell specialty scientific products and instruments. As a result, traditional distributors normally focus on selling commodity products. Conversely, direct sales provide suppliers with greater control and contact with their customers, enabling them to provide the technical assistance necessary for the sale of specialty scientific products. However, direct sales are often expensive and inefficient. Many suppliers have Web sites that are essentially online versions of their catalogs, but these sites do not address the primary cause of inefficiency for buyers --the inability to find products and consolidate orders from different suppliers quickly and easily through a single service. The Online Market Opportunity The limitations of the traditional scientific products supply chain and the significant information needs of scientists make the scientific products market well-suited to an automated e-commerce solution. Moreover, the scientific community is already accustomed to using the Internet. According to a recent study by BioInformatics, Inc., 80% of the 680 scientists surveyed had ordered a consumer product or service through the Internet and approximately 38% of them had purchased life science products over the Internet. We believe this indicates that scientists will be comfortable adopting e-commerce solutions for purchases of scientific products. The following percentage of scientists responding to the study rated e-commerce superior to traditional purchasing in each of the following areas: .82% of the 650 respondents rated e-commerce superior in reducing administrative costs; .73% of the 656 respondents rated e-commerce superior in speed of delivery to end users; and .70% of the 663 respondents rated e-commerce superior in fast, accurate ordering. Source: BioInformatics, Inc. 319611985. BioInformatics, Inc. is a market research and consulting firm, specializing in supporting marketing and sales executives in the life science, medical device and pharmaceutical industries. For these reasons, we believe that the scientific products market will be an early adopter of e-commerce solutions and that we are well positioned to take advantage of this market opportunity. The SciQuest.com Marketplace Solution The SciQuest.com marketplace solution provides comprehensive public Web sites and customized private sites that address the current limitations of the scientific products supply chain by streamlining the process of buying and selling of scientific products and reducing associated transaction costs. Our distributor-neutral approach allows us to create an open and scalable marketplace that we believe is more attractive to both buyers and sellers. Our solutions serve three primary and distinct customers: Scientists. Our solutions offer scientists online tools to streamline the process of finding, comparing, purchasing, tracking and managing laboratory supplies. By reducing the time scientists spend on these functions, our solutions allow them to be more productive and spend more time on research and testing. Our solutions enable a scientist to: . search our extensive database, using our industry-leading taxonomies, to compare products, attributes and technical data across multiple suppliers; . locate a specific chemical, equipment or supply item; and . consolidate, purchase and track orders from multiple suppliers through the convenience of a single Web site, 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Purchasing Professionals. Our solutions allow purchasing professionals to automate order processing, consolidate purchase orders and payments and obtain purchasing information. This provides purchasing professionals with greater access to purchasing information to better monitor and control purchasing patterns and to implement and enforce uniform purchasing policies that reduce procurement costs. Our solutions enable purchasing professionals to: . consolidate purchases from multiple suppliers onto one order; . streamline the purchasing process and reduce the likelihood of errors; . communicate and control purchasing policies and rules; and . access detailed purchasing information and reports. In addition, our solutions are designed to be compatible with leading enterprise software systems and do not require organizations to install additional enterprise software systems. This compatibility allows organizations to avoid the expense, time and training typically required to install and support new enterprise software. Suppliers. Our solutions offer suppliers a more efficient sales channel that cost-effectively provides many of the benefits of direct sales and distribution. As a result, by participating in our marketplace suppliers can expand their market reach and reduce customer acquisition and order processing costs. Our solutions enable suppliers to: . more cost-effectively market and sell products through access to our global audience of scientists and purchasing professionals; . access valuable market and customer data; . leverage our e-commerce functionality without capital investment; . easily update product information; . introduce new products to qualified buyers quickly and economically; and . maintain contact with their customers.

We offer our customers 24-hour direct access to the global over-the-counter, or OTC, foreign exchange markets, where participants trade directly with one another rather than through a central exchange or clearinghouse. We also offer some of our retail customers access to other global markets on an OTC basis, including the spot gold and silver markets, as well as equity indices and commodities via instruments linked to the performance of the price of an underlying security called “contracts-for-difference”. Our trading platforms provide a wide array of information and analytical tools that allow our customers to identify, analyze and execute their trading strategies efficiently and cost-effectively. We believe our proprietary technology, multilingual customer service professionals and effective educational programs provide a high degree of customer satisfaction and loyalty. Furthermore, our scalable and flexible technology infrastructure allows us to enhance our product service offerings to meet the rapidly changing needs of the marketplace. Forex trading is one of the fastest-growing areas of retail trading in the financial services industry. In a forex trade, participants buy one currency and simultaneously sell another currency. We refer to the two currencies that make up a forex trade as a currency pair. The first currency noted in the pair is the base currency and the second is the counter currency. According to the 2010 Triennial Bank Survey from the Bank for International Settlements, average daily turnover in the global forex market in April 2010 was $4.0 trillion, an increase of approximately 20.0% from the $3.3 trillion reported by the Bank for International Settlements in April 2007. The Bank for International Settlements notes that the U.S. dollar is the most commonly traded currency, with approximately 85.0% of all forex trades involving the U.S. dollar. The forex market has emerged from its previous role as a currency hedge to become an investable asset class. Historically, access to the forex market was only available to commercial and investment banks, corporations, hedge funds and other large financial institutions. In the last decade, retail investors have gained increasing access to this market largely through the emergence of online retail forex providers like us. According to a 2010 analysis by the Aite Group, a financial services market research firm, global retail forex trading volumes have grown from average daily volumes of approximately $10.0 billion in 2001 to approximately $125.0 billion in 2009 representing a compound annual growth rate of 37.1%. We have a geographically diverse customer base and currently service customers residing in more than 140 countries worldwide. For the year ended December 31, 2009, 49.7% of our customer base was located in the United States, representing approximately 54.5% of our total annual trading volume, while approximately 50.3% of our customer base was located outside of the United States, representing approximately 45.5% of our total annual trading volume. Our total annual customer trading volume, which is based on the U.S. dollar equivalent of notional amounts traded, grew from $231.9 billion in 2005 to $1.2 trillion in 2009, representing a compound annual growth rate of 50.8%. Our annual net revenue grew from $37.9 million in 2005 to $153.3 million in 2009, representing a compound annual growth rate of 41.8%. Our net income grew from $8.2 million in 2005 to $28.0 million in 2009, representing a compound annual growth rate of 35.9%. Our adjusted net income, a non-GAAP financial measure which represents our net income/(loss) excluding the change in fair value of the embedded derivative in our preferred stock, increased from $8.2 million in 2005 to $26.3 million in 2009, representing a compound annual growth rate of 33.8%. Our forex trading activities are regulated in the United States by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the National Futures Association, in the United Kingdom by the Financial Services Authority, in Japan by the Financial Services Agency, in Hong Kong by the Securities and Futures Commission and in Australia by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission. Our U.S. broker-dealer, GAIN Securities, Inc., is regulated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the Financial Industry Regulating Authority. For the nine months ended September 30, 2010, approximately 69.9% of our trading volume was attributable to customers resident in a jurisdiction where we are licensed, regulated or where we deal with customers cross-border in a manner which does not require us to be regulated in that jurisdiction. We use financial metrics, including tradable retail accounts and traded retail accounts, to measure our aggregate customer account activity. Tradable retail accounts represent retail customers who maintain cash balances with us that are sufficient to execute a trade in compliance with our policies. As of September 30, 2010 we had 70,618 tradable retail accounts compared to 47,374 as of September 30, 2009. We believe the number of tradable retail accounts is an important indicator of our ability to attract new retail customers that can potentially lead to trading volume and revenue in the future, however, it does not represent actual trades executed. We believe that the most relevant measurement which correlates to volume and revenue is the number of traded retail accounts, because this represents retail customers who executed a transaction with us during a particular period. During the nine months ended September 30, 2010, 52,486 traded retail accounts executed a forex transaction with us compared to 43,565 traded retail accounts for the nine months ended September 30, 2009, representing an increase of 20.5%. Our customer base is comprised of self-directed retail traders, managed retail traders and institutional customers who utilize our online platforms and tools to trade forex and contracts-for-difference. For the nine months ended September 30, 2010, self-directed retail investors represented 79.0% of our customer trading volume. Managed accounts, which are accounts managed by authorized intermediaries trading on behalf of a retail account holder, represented 8.7% of our customer trading volume for the nine months ended September 30, 2010. Institutional customers represented 12.4% of our volume for the nine months ended September 30, 2010. We seek to attract and support customers through direct, indirect and institutional channels. Our primary direct channel for our retail business is our Internet website, FOREX.com, which is available in English, traditional and simplified Chinese, Japanese, Russian and Arabic. It provides retail traders of all experience levels with full trading capabilities, along with extensive educational and support tools. Our indirect channel includes our relationships with retail financial services firms, such as broker-dealers, futures commission merchants, and retail banking institutions. These firms offer our trading services to their existing customers under their own brand in exchange for a revenue-sharing arrangement with us. We refer to these firms as our “white label partners”. We also have relationships with currency brokers who refer their customers to us for a fee. We refer to these firms as “introducing brokers”. Globally, we have relationships with more than 500 white label partners and introducing brokers who were active for the nine months ended September 30, 2010. Our institutional channel, which we launched in March 2010, sources our institutional customers, consisting of commercial and investment banks, hedge funds and other professional traders, through our direct sales team. Our total customer trading volume sourced through direct, indirect, and institutional channels was 50.4%, 37.3%, and 12.4%, respectively for the nine months ended September 30, 2010. For the year ended December 31, 2009, total customer trading volume sourced through direct and indirect channels was 65.4% and 34.6%, respectively. The majority of our revenue is derived from our retail customers’ trading activity in our forex and contracts-for-difference product offerings. We generally act as the counterparty to our retail customers’ trades and as an agent for trades conducted by our institutional customers. The counterparties to our institutional customers’ trades are third party financial institutions. We receive transaction fees for our institutional customers’ trades and the third-party financial institution who is counterparty to the transaction incurs the market risk. For our retail customer business, we have used our extensive experience in the global OTC markets and online trading to develop risk- management systems and procedures that allow us to manage market and credit risk in accordance with predefined exposure limits in real-time. A key component of our approach to managing risk is that we do not actively initiate market positions for our own account in anticipation of future movements in the relative prices of products we offer. We refer to such positions as proprietary directional market positions. Instead, we continuously evaluate market risk exposure and actively hedge a portion of our customer transactions on a continuous basis. For the nine months ended September 30, 2010, a minimum of 90.9% of our average daily trading volume, on any given day, was either naturally hedged, where one of our customers executing a trade in a currency is offset by a trade taken by another customer, or hedged by us with a third party financial institution. To facilitate our risk-management activities, we maintain levels of capital in excess of those currently required under applicable regulations. As of September 30, 2010, we maintained capital levels of $92.5 million, which represents approximately 2.9 times the capital we are required to hold. We believe that we provide our customers with access to forex liquidity at competitive rates. We maintain relationships with three established global prime brokers, including Deutsche Bank AG, UBS AG, and The Royal Bank of Scotland plc as well as relationships with 13 additional wholesale forex trading partners and access to other trading platforms and other wholesale forex trading partners, which give us access to over 25 potential liquidity providers. We believe these relationships give us access to a pool of forex liquidity, which ensures that we are able to execute our customers’ trades in any of the 39 currency pairs or six contracts-for-difference product offerings we offer and in the notional amount they request. We believe that our approach to managing market and credit risk provides us with a diversified revenue stream that is governed by both risk-management and profit maximization principles. --------- We were incorporated in Delaware in October 1999 as GAIN Capital, Inc.In order to expand, either directly or through wholly-owned subsidiaries, into business activities not regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission or the National Futures Association, on August 1, 2003, all outstanding capital stock of GAIN Capital, Inc. was converted into capital stock of GAIN Capital Group, Inc. pursuant to an agreement and plan of merger by and among GAIN Capital Group, Inc., GAIN Merger Sub Inc.

People connect with music on a fundamentally personal and deeply emotional level. Whether it’s a song someone first heard ten years ago or one they’ve just discovered, if they connect with that music on our service, a strong bond is forged at that moment with Pandora. Just as we value music, we also hold a deep respect for those who create it. We celebrate and hold dear the individuals who have chosen to make music, from megastars to talented new and emerging artists. ---- Pandora is the leader in internet radio in the United States, offering a personalized experience for each of our listeners. We have pioneered a new form of radio – one that uses intrinsic qualities of music to initially create stations and then adapts playlists in real-time based on the individual feedback of each listener. In April 2011, we had over 90 million registered users and we added a new registered user every second on average. We have more than a 50% share of all internet radio listening time among the top 20 stations and networks in the United States, according to a November 2010 report by Ando Media, or Ando, an audience measurement and ads management firm. Since we launched the Pandora service in 2005, our listeners have created over 1.4 billion stations. The Music Genome Project and our playlist generating algorithms form the technology foundation that enables us to deliver personalized radio to our listeners. These proprietary technologies power our ability to predict listener music preferences and play music content suited to the tastes of each individual listener. The extensive musicological database of the Music Genome Project has been meticulously built by a team of professional musicians and musicologists analyzing up to 450 attributes, or genes, for every song in our vast collection, to capture the fundamental musical properties of each recording. When a listener enters a single song, artist, composer or genre to start a station – a process we call seeding – our complex mathematical algorithms combine the genes cataloged by the Music Genome Project with individual and collective feedback to suggest songs and build personalized playlists. Over the last decade, our music analysts have been analyzing songs, our engineers have been organizing the genome and refining our playlist generating algorithms and, since the launch of our service five years ago, our listeners have been giving us feedback as they use our service. Containing over 800,000 songs from over 80,000 artists, we believe the Music Genome Project is the most comprehensive analysis of music in the world. We make the Pandora service available through a variety of distribution channels. In addition to streaming our service to traditional computers, we have developed Pandora applications for smartphones, such as Android phones, Blackberry phones and the iPhone, and partnered with the makers of over 200 consumer electronics devices, including Alpine, Panasonic, Pioneer, Samsung and Sony. We have also developed relationships with major automobile manufacturers, including Ford Motor Company, Mercedes-Benz and MINI (BMW Group), and with suppliers to major automobile manufacturers, to integrate the Pandora service into current and future automotive sound systems. Additionally, General Motors, Hyundai and Toyota have publicly announced their plans for future Pandora integrations. To date, the Pandora app has been downloaded more than 50 million times on the most popular smartphone platforms in the United States. According to a September 2010 report by Nielsen, a media measurement firm, the Pandora app is a top five most used app across all four major smartphone platforms in the United States. In January 2011, the Pandora app was the #2 all-time downloaded free iPhone app and the #1 all-time downloaded free iPad app, according to Apple. We offer our service to listeners at no cost and we generate revenue primarily from advertising. We also offer a subscription service to listeners. Our advertising solutions address three large advertising markets in the United States: online display, rich media and video, mobile and broadcast radio. The online display, rich media and video advertising market was $9.8 billion in 2010, and is expected to grow at a 15% compound annual growth rate to $17.0 billion in 2014, according to IDC, a provider of market intelligence. Just as shifting consumer consumption to online media has driven online advertising growth, the mobile advertising market is expected to grow as more users access the internet through mobile devices. IDC estimates that in 2010 there were 103 million consumer mobile devices using the internet in the United States, and forecasts that this number will grow to 168 million in 2014. Along with consumer mobile internet usage growth, mobile advertising is expected to grow rapidly, from $877 million in 2010 to $6.8 billion in 2014, a 67% compound annual growth rate according to IDC. Our audio advertising products also address the broadcast radio ad market which was $13.4 billion in 2010 and is expected to reach $13.7 billion in 2014, according to IDC.

In December 2010, we had more than 196 million unique visitors to our network of websites, according to comScore. We offer our members a wide variety of online services so that they can interact with each other and access the content available on our websites. Our most heavily visited websites include AdultFriendFinder.com, Amigos.com, AsiaFriendFinder.com, Cams.com, FriendFinder.com, BigChurch.com and SeniorFriendFinder.com. For the year ended December 31, 2010 we had net revenue, income from operations and net losses of $346.0 million, $71.7 million and ($43.2) million, respectively. Our revenues to date have been primarily derived from online subscription and paid-usage for our products and services. These products and services are delivered primarily through two highly scalable revenue-generating technology platforms: • Social Networking. Approximately 70% of our total net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2010 were generated through our targeted social networking technology platform. Our social networking technology platform provides users who register or purchase subscriptions to one or more of our websites with the ability to communicate and to establish new connections with other users via our personal chat rooms, instant messaging and e-mail applications and to create, post and view content of interest. We have been able to rapidly create and seamlessly maintain multiple websites tailored to specific categories or genres and designed to cater to targeted audiences with mutual interests. We believe that our ability to create and operate a diverse network of specific interest websites with unique, user- generated content in a cost-effective manner is a significant competitive differentiator that allows us to implement a subscription-fee based revenue model while many other popular social networking websites rely primarily upon free-access, advertising-based revenue models. • Live Interactive Video. Approximately 22% of our total net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2010 were generated through our live interactive video technology platform. Our live interactive video technology platform is a live video broadcast platform that enables models to broadcast from independent studios throughout the world and interact with our users via instant messaging and video. We believe our live interactive video platform provides a unique offering including bi-directional and omni-directional video and interactive features that allow models to communicate with and attract users through a variety of mediums including blogs, newsletters and video. In addition, we believe the reliability of our live interactive video technology platform, which had approximately 99.1% uptime during 2010, is a key factor allowing us to maintain a large base of users. In addition to our revenue-generating technology platforms, we have invested significant time and resources into developing our back-end marketing, analytics and billing technologies, which are a key contributor to the success of our business. We have developed proprietary systems to allow our marketing affiliates to maximize their revenue for our mutual benefit. These systems include proprietary white-labeling solutions, in which we provide back-end technology solutions to permit affiliates and marketing partners to deliver our products and services while maintaining the affiliate’s and marketing partner’s own branding and style, self-optimizing ad spots, and a robust banner optimization engine that automatically chooses the best possible site and banner to promote in a given ad spot. Our marketing technology has also enabled the creation and continued growth of our network of more than 250,000 affiliates, which we believe is one of the largest of its kind in the world and a significant barrier to entry to potential and existing competitors. Similarly, our proprietary analytics technology provides us with an advantage relative to less sophisticated competitors by enabling us to estimate future revenue based on short-term response to our advertising campaigns, as well as providing for analysis of key data and metrics in order to optimize our marketing spend and maximize the revenues our websites generate. Our robust billing platform allows our customers to pay using many of the widely-adopted methods of e-commerce, both domestically as well as internationally. We categorize our users into five categories: visitors, registrants, members, subscribers and paid users. • Visitors. Visitors are users who visit our websites but do not necessarily register. We believe we achieve large numbers of unique visitors because of our focus on continuously enhancing the user experience and expanding the breadth of our services. We had more than 196 million unique worldwide visitors in the month of December 2010, according to comScore. • Registrants. Registrants are visitors who complete a free registration form on one of our websites by giving basic identification information and submitting their e-mail address. For the year ended December 31, 2010, we averaged more than 6.4 million new registrations on our websites each month. Some of our registrants are also members, as described below. • Members. Members are registrants who log into one of our websites and make use of our free products and services. For the year ended December 31, 2010, we averaged more than 3.9 million new members on our websites each month. • Subscribers. Subscribers are members who purchase daily, three-day, weekly, monthly, quarterly, annual or lifetime subscriptions for one or more of our websites. Subscribers have full access to our websites and may access special features. For the year ended December 31, 2010, we had a monthly average of approximately 1.0 million paying subscribers. • Paid Users. Paid users are members who purchase products or services on a pay-by-usage basis. For the year ended December 31, 2010, we averaged approximately 1.6 million purchased minutes by paid users each month. We focus on the following key business metrics to evaluate the effectiveness of our operating strategies. • Average Revenue per Subscriber. We calculate average revenue per subscriber, or ARPU, by dividing net revenue for the period by the average number of subscribers in the period and by the number of months in the period. As such, our ARPU is a monthly calculation. For the year ended December 31, 2010, our average monthly revenue per subscriber was $20.49. • Churn. Churn is calculated by dividing terminations of subscriptions during the period by the total number of subscribers at the beginning of that period. Our average monthly churn rate, which measures the rate of loss of subscribers, decreased from approximately 16.3% per month for the year ended December 31, 2009 to approximately 16.1% per month for the year ended December 31, 2010. • Cost Per Gross Addition. Cost per gross addition, or CPGA, is calculated by adding affiliate commission expense plus ad buy expenses and dividing by new subscribers during the measurement period. Our CPGA increased from $46.89 for the year ended December 31, 2009 to $47.25 for the year ended December 31, 2010. • Average Lifetime Net Revenue Per Subscriber. Average Lifetime Net Revenue Per Subscriber is calculated by multiplying the average lifetime (in months) of a subscriber by ARPU for the measurement period and then subtracting the CPGA for the measurement period. Our Average Lifetime Net Revenue Per Subscriber increased from $79.34 for the year ended December 31, 2009 to $80.17 for the year ended December 31, 2010. While we monitor many statistics in the overall management of our business, we believe that Average Lifetime Net Revenue Per Subscriber and the number of subscribers are particularly helpful metrics for gaining a meaningful understanding of our business as they provide an indication of total revenue and profit generated from our base of subscribers inclusive of affiliate commissions and advertising costs required to generate new subscriptions. In addition to our social networks and live interactive video platforms, we also offer professionally-generated content through our premium content technology platform and our non-internet entertainment business. Through websites such as Penthouse.com and HotBox.com, our subscribers and paid users have access to our collection of more than 15,000 hours of professional video, which includes our library of more than 800 standard and high-definition full- length feature films and one million professionally produced images. We began shooting all of our content in 3D in September 2010. Additionally, subscribers have access to editorial content, chat rooms and other interactive features. In addition to our online products and services, we also have a non-technology legacy entertainment business, in which we produce and distribute original pictorial and video content via traditional distribution channels including licensing and retail DVD channels, and license the globally-recognized Penthouse brand to a variety of consumer product companies and entertainment venues and public branded men’s lifestyle magazines. ----- Our executive offices are located at 6800 Broken Sound Parkway, Suite 200, Boca Raton, Florida 33487 and our telephone number is (561) 912-7000.

We also operate in Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Belarus. Our mission is to answer any question internet users may have.

We also aggregate and organize extensive local, national and international content and offer a broad range of additional services. Our search and many of our services are location-based and are available in versions tailored for mobile and other digital platforms and devices. Benefiting from Russia's long-standing educational focus on mathematics and engineering, we have drawn upon the considerable local talent pool to create a leading technology company. For over 20 years, our founding team has been developing and optimizing search technology, which has formed the core of our business and helped Yandex become one of the best known brands in Russia. Our users are our first priority, and we are committed to advancing our technology to continuously improve their internet experience. Our search engine uses our proprietary algorithms to provide relevant results, which we structure and present in an editorially neutral and user-friendly manner. With a focus on our principal geographic markets, our search technology allows us to provide local search results in more than 1,400 cities.

Our homepage can easily be customized by users to address their individual interests. We derive substantially all of our revenues from online advertising. We enable advertisers to deliver targeted, cost-effective ads that are relevant to our users' needs, interests and locations. Most of our revenues are derived from text-based advertising, which uses keywords selected by our advertisers to deliver ads based on a particular user query, the content of a website or webpage being viewed, or user behavior or characteristics. We derive a smaller portion of our revenues from display advertising, which principally consists of graphical ads that appear on specific webpages. Our ads are clearly marked and separate from our organic search results and from the content of the webpages on which they may also appear. We do not serve intrusive ads, such as ""pop-ups,"" that might detract from our users' experience. In addition to serving ads on our own search results and other webpages, we deliver ads to the thousands of third-party websites that make up our Yandex ad network. Through our ad network, we generate revenue for both our network partners and ourselves and extend the audience reach of our advertisers. Our Yandex.Direct service, launched in 2001, is an automated, auction-based system for the placement of text-based advertising in Russia that makes it easy for advertisers to bid for desired keywords and to obtain the best price for their ads.

Traditionally, local merchants have tried to reach consumers and generate sales through a variety of methods, including the yellow pages, direct mail, newspaper, radio, television and online advertisements, promotions and the occasional guy dancing on a street corner in a gorilla suit. By bringing the brick and mortar world of local commerce onto the internet, Groupon is creating a new way for local merchants to attract customers and sell goods and services. We provide consumers with savings and help them discover what to do, eat, see and buy in the places where they live and work. We started Groupon in October 2008 and believe the growth of our business demonstrates the power of our solution and the size of our market opportunity: • We increased our revenue from $1.2 million in the second quarter of 2009 to $430.2 million in the third quarter of 2011. We generated these revenues from gross billings of $3.3 million for the second quarter of 2009 as compared to gross billings of $1,157.2 million for the third quarter of 2011. We had net income of $21,000 for the second quarter of 2009 as compared to a net loss of $10.6 million for the third quarter of 2011. • We expanded from five North American markets as of June 30, 2009 to 175 North American markets and 45 countries as of September 30, 2011. Revenue from our international and North American operations was $268.7 million and $161.5 million, respectively, in the third quarter of 2011. • We increased our subscriber base from 152,203 as of June 30, 2009 to 142.9 million as of September 30, 2011. A total of 43,014 customers purchased Groupons through the end of the second quarter of 2009 as compared to 29.5 million through the end of the third quarter of 2011, including 16.0 million customers who have purchased more than one Groupon since January 1, 2009. • We increased the number of merchants featured in our marketplace from 212 in the second quarter of 2009 to 78,649 in the third quarter of 2011. • We sold 116,231 Groupons in the second quarter of 2009 compared to 33.0 million Groupons in the third quarter of 2011. • We grew from 37 employees as of June 30, 2009 to 10,418 employees as of September 30, 2011. Each day we email our subscribers discounted offers for goods and services that are targeted by location and personal preferences. Consumers also access our deals directly through our websites and mobile applications. A typical deal might offer a $20 Groupon that can be redeemed for $40 in value at a restaurant, spa, yoga studio, car wash or other local merchant. Customers purchase Groupons from us and redeem them with our merchants. Our revenue is the purchase price paid by the customer for the Groupon less an agreed upon percentage of the purchase price paid to the featured merchant. Our gross billings represent the gross amounts collected from customers for Groupons sold, and we consider this metric to be an indicator of our growth and business performance as it measures the dollar volume of transactions through our marketplace. Gross billings are not equivalent to revenues or any other metric presented in our consolidated financial statements. ------ We are a Delaware corporation.

Our on-demand software, the Responsys Interact Suite, provides marketers with a set of applications to create, execute, optimize and automate marketing campaigns across these key interactive channels. Our solution consists of our on-demand software and professional services, all focused on enabling the marketing success of our customers. We sell our on-demand software and professional services primarily through a direct sales force and target enterprise and larger mid-market companies that seek to implement more advanced marketing programs across interactive channels. For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2009 and 2010, our total revenue was $50.1 million, $66.6 million and $94.1 million, respectively, representing year-over-year growth of 33% and 41% in 2009 and 2010, respectively. As of December 31, 2010, we had 277 customers of varied size across a wide variety of industries, including retail and consumer, travel, financial services and technology. Marketing is undergoing a significant shift as rapid adoption of digital technology has dramatically changed consumer behavior. Interactive channels, including email, mobile, social and the web, are rapidly supplanting traditional media channels as consumers’ primary source of entertainment and information. This has created both an opportunity and an imperative for companies to market to their customers by engaging them across all of these interactive channels. According to Forrester Research, Inc., or Forrester, U.S. spending on interactive marketing is expected to increase to nearly $55 billion and represent 21% of all marketing spending by 2014, as marketers shift dollars away from traditional media toward interactive channels. (1) According to Forrester, U.S. interactive marketing spend on email, mobile and social media, the primary interactive channels currently used for relationship marketing, is expected to grow from $2.9 billion in 2010 to nearly $6.5 billion by 2014, representing a compound annual growth rate of 22%. (1) Interactive channels enable marketers to substantially improve the effectiveness of their relationship marketing efforts by executing more relevant and timely campaigns to their customers and known prospects. However, this shift to interactive marketing has also caused the execution of marketing campaigns to become increasingly complex, real-time and dependent on technology. We believe that to capture the opportunity provided by interactive channels, they need a solution built for relationship marketing across those interactive channels. Our Interact Suite is a software-as-a-service, or SaaS, platform that empowers relationship marketers to effectively execute marketing campaigns across the key interactive channels—email, mobile, social and the web. --------- We were incorporated in the state of California in 1998.

We have launched the most successful social games in the industry in each of the last three years and have generated over $1.5 billion in cumulative revenue and over $2.0 billion in cumulative bookings since our inception in 2007. Our games are accessible to players worldwide on Facebook, other social networks and mobile platforms, wherever and whenever they want. Currently, substantially all of our revenue is generated from players accessing our games via the Facebook platform. We operate our games as live services, by which we mean that we continue to support and update games after launch and gather daily, metrics-based player feedback that enables us to continually enhance our games by adding new content and features. All of our games are free to play, and we generate revenue through the in-game sale of virtual goods and advertising. We believe our leadership position in social games is the result of our significant investment in our people, content, brand, technology and infrastructure. Our leadership position in social games is defined by the following: . Large and Global Community of Players. According to AppData, as of September 30, 2011, we had the largest player audience on Facebook, with more MAUs than the next eight social game developers combined. Our players are also more engaged, with our games being played by 54 million average daily active users, or DAUs, worldwide as of September 30, 2011. According to AppData, as of September 30, 2011, our games were played by more DAUs than the next 14 social game developers combined. . Leading Portfolio of Social Games. We have many of the most popular and successful online social games, including CityVille , FarmVille , Mafia Wars , Words with Friends and Zynga Poker . As of September 30, 2011, according to AppData, we had four of the top five social games on Facebook based on DAUs. On mobile platforms, we have several of the most popular games, including Words with Friends and Hanging with Friends , which were the top two games in the word category based on the number of downloads from the Apple App Store for iPhone as of September 30, 2011. . Rapid Game Growth. Our games have achieved rapid and widespread adoption. FarmVille grew to 43 million MAUs in its first 100 days and CityVille grew to 61 million MAUs in its first 50 days. One of our recently launched web-based games, Empires & Allies , grew to be the second most popular game on Facebook, based on MAUs as measured by AppData, less than a month after launch. In June 2011, we launched Hanging with Friends , which became the most downloaded game in the Apple App Store for iPhone during its first week. . Scalable Technology and Data. We process and serve more than a petabyte of content for our players every day, a volume of data that we believe is unmatched in the social game industry. We continually analyze game data to optimize our games. We believe that combining data analytics with creative game design enables us to create a superior player experience. We leverage our scale to increase player engagement, cross-promote our portfolio of games, continually enhance existing games, launch new games and build the Zynga brand. We believe our scale results in network effects that deliver compelling value to our players, and we are committed to making significant investments that will further grow our community of players, their engagement and our monetization over time. We have achieved significant growth in our business in a short period of time. From 2008 to 2010, our revenue increased from $19.4 million to $597.5 million, our bookings increased from $35.9 million to $838.9 million, we went from a net loss of $22.1 million to net income of $90.6 million and our adjusted EBITDA increased from $4.5 million to $392.7 million. For the nine months ended September 30, 2011, our revenue was $828.9 million, our bookings were $849.0 million, our net income was $30.7 million and our adjusted EBITDA was $235.5 million. Consistent with our “free-to-play” business model, only a small portion of our players are paying players. During the nine months ended September 30, 2011, we had approximately 6.7 million unique payers. This number excludes payers on certain mobile platforms and those who used certain smaller web-based payment methods. Because the opportunity for social interactions increases as the number of players increases, we believe that maintaining and growing our overall number of players, including the number of players who may not purchase virtual goods, is important to the success of our business. As a result, we believe that the number of players who choose to purchase virtual goods will continue to constitute a small portion of our overall players as our business grows. Our top three games historically have contributed the majority of our revenue. Our top three games accounted for 93%, 83%, 78% and 59% of our online game revenue in 2008, 2009, 2010, and for the nine months ended September 30, 2011, respectively. ----------- We were originally organized in April 2007 as a California limited liability company under the name Presidio Media LLC, and we converted to a Delaware corporation in October 2007.

Through our ImproveNet.com and ImproveNetPro.com Web sites, matching services and targeted advertising, we are creating a national marketplace for home improvement products and services in which homeowners, service providers and suppliers of home improvement products benefit from an organized and efficient online flow of information and communication. We generate job leads for service providers from highly interested homeowners within their geographic area using our proprietary matching service. In 1998, we received approximately 33,500 job submissions valued at a total of approximately $1.1 billion, compared to the estimated total expenditures for the residential home improvement market for 1998 of approximately $120.7 billion, according to the United States Department of Commerce. In 1999, we received approximately 106,500 job submissions valued at a total of approximately $2.7 billion, compared to the estimated total expenditures for the residential home improvement market for 1999 of approximately $126.7 billion, according to the National Association of Home Builders. We have designed our services to deliver a satisfying home improvement experience to homeowners and assist them through the four phases of the home improvement process: dream and design, plan and budget, hire and build and fix and maintain. We generate revenues from our three constituents: - service providers pay us lead fees and win fees for our matching service that are included in service revenues; - suppliers of home improvement products and services as well as other advertisers pay us advertising fees for the purchase of advertising space on our Web sites that are included in advertising revenues; and - homeowners pay us fees for our premium home improvement services that are included in service revenues and that to date have not been significant. INDUSTRY BACKGROUND THE HOME IMPROVEMENT INDUSTRY The home improvement industry is fragmented. According to the National Association of Home Builders, total expenditures for residential home improvements for 1999 were $126.7 billion. According to the United States Census Bureau, there are currently 70.5 million owner-occupied homes out of a total of 120 million housing units. The participants in the home improvement industry can be grouped into three categories: homeowners, service providers and suppliers of home improvement products. These participants face distinct challenges in meeting their individual objectives. HOMEOWNERS The appearance, care, maintenance and general working condition of a home is highly important to a homeowner. Maintaining and improving the home involve an ongoing financial and emotional investment in the homeowner's core asset. To manage a home improvement project, a homeowner needs to design the project, establish a budget for the project, find and select service providers, and guide it to its completion. To a large extent, homeowners currently must rely upon word-of-mouth recommendations, Yellow Pages and local newspaper advertisements, and magazines and books to accomplish these tasks. None of these resources provides immediate, objective, reliable and customized information. As a result, homeowners are generally poorly informed and uncertain about how best to identify and locate a reputable, experienced and competitively priced service provider and to design and budget for their projects. Further, homeowners seldom have the time to manage their home improvement projects or have access to an experienced home improvement advisor. Because of all these factors, they often pay a high emotional and financial cost to complete a home improvement project and are not always satisfied with the results. SERVICE PROVIDERS Based upon a compilation of industry sources, we believe there are up to 900,000 service providers in the United States. The home improvement industry is characterized by a high rate of turnover among local contractors. These service providers have few channels to communicate effectively with homeowners or with one another. There is neither an industry-wide certification based on work quality nor a code of conduct and ethics for contractors as there is for architects and designers. As a result, reputable contractors are often unable to differentiate themselves based on reliability, adequate capitalization and areas of specialization. Service providers currently rely on word-of-mouth recommendations, the Yellow Pages and other traditional mass media advertising that require them to pay upfront fixed costs. Therefore, service providers must allocate significant time, money and energy to qualifying and verifying the leads they receive. Typically, small independent contractors experience difficulty in predicting lead flow, managing staffing and working capital requirements and, most importantly, systematically building a stable business. SUPPLIERS OF HOME IMPROVEMENT PRODUCTS According to REMODELING'S 1998-1999 Buyers Guide, there are approximately 3,000 suppliers of home improvement products in the United States. Although there are some well-known brand names supplying a wide array of home improvement products, the broader industry is comprised of local and regional firms with limited means to distribute and market their products effectively to homeowners. According to ADVERTISING AGE, approximately $950 million was spent in 1998 on advertising in the home improvement industry. Currently, the majority of supplier advertising dollars is spent on co-marketing and co-branding advertising and print and broadcast advertising. These traditional media lack a centralized database of information that can be searched based on specified terms, and the ability to conduct two-way communications. Although suppliers have often used traditional media effectively to build brand recognition, they have difficulty using traditional media to target homeowners who are in the process of making time-critical purchasing decisions regarding home improvement products. THE INTERNET HOME IMPROVEMENT OPPORTUNITY The Internet has fundamentally changed the way that individuals and businesses communicate, obtain information, advertise, purchase goods and services and transact business. International Data Corporation estimates that the number of Internet users will grow to 177.0 million in the United States by the end of 2003 and projects that commerce revenue on the Internet in the United States will increase from approximately $37.2 billion in 1998 to $707.9 billion in 2003. Forrester Research projects that advertising spending on the Internet in the United States will exceed $2.8 billion in 1999 and grow to more than $17.2 billion by 2003. We believe that an opportunity exists for an online home improvement marketplace that provides a central repository of information for the benefit of homeowners, service providers and suppliers. This marketplace would enable homeowners to access design and planning tools, find service providers and obtain other project management services. This marketplace would also enable service providers to access job leads, differentiate themselves from competitors and communicate with fellow professionals. Finally, this marketplace would enable suppliers to market their products to a targeted audience of homeowners at the time they are making time-critical purchasing decisions. THE IMPROVENET SOLUTION We provide home improvement information and services on the Internet. We aggregate and organize information and design tools for homeowners, generate job leads for service providers and provide home improvement project information to suppliers. We independently screen and monitor contractors, designers and architects nationwide to ensure that our homeowners' qualified job leads are matched with pre-screened service providers. We offer suppliers coordinated advertising to homeowners and service providers while they are making home improvement purchasing decisions. Through our Web sites, matching and advisory services and targeted advertising, we are creating a national online marketplace for home improvement products and services. Our solution offers the following benefits: FOR HOMEOWNERS: - ACCESS TO QUALITY SERVICE PROVIDERS. Our screening process is designed to identify the leaders in quality and service in each of our local markets. To pass our screening criteria, service providers must have a clean credit and legal history, all necessary licenses, appropriate insurance and no significant negative references from customers or other service providers. We re-screen the service providers in our database approximately semi-annually. By creating a national database of screened service providers, we improve the likelihood that homeowners who contact us will hire qualified, experienced and reputable service providers. - COST-EFFECTIVE AND CONVENIENT SERVICES. For projects greater than $500, our matching process solicits between two and four service providers on behalf of homeowners who might otherwise settle for a single bid, creating a competitive marketplace for their home improvement project. We choose the service providers by matching their geographical, job type and job size preferences with the homeowner's job specification. We contact selected service providers by fax, e-mail or by posting to ImproveNetPro.com. Our goal is to have the selected service providers contact the homeowner directly to discuss the job in detail within 72 hours of when we provide the homeowner with the service providers' names. Our service providers currently meet this goal approximately 50% of the time. In addition, we offer homeowners the ability to search for home improvement services and to plan their current projects using our interactive planning tools from home or work 24 hours a day, seven days a week. We assign a personal project advisor to each home improvement project. The project advisor is available to guide and advise the homeowner and the selected service provider throughout the project. - ONLINE PROJECT ASSISTANCE. We believe our array of online services, including our product showcase, our design gallery and our planning and estimating tools, provides answers to homeowners' diverse questions and needs regarding home improvement and repairs. Our Web site allows each homeowner to generate ideas from the product showcase and design gallery and access the personal project folder, an archive of previous project ideas and communications. For a fee, we provide premium services such as legal and credit reports on contractors outside the ImproveNet network for $29 per report and bid and contract assessment assistance for $50 per contract. FOR SERVICE PROVIDERS: - QUALITY JOB LEADS. Our project advisors call each homeowner after we receive a job to confirm that the homeowner is interested and to assist with refining the details of the job. Service providers who receive leads through our proprietary matching service benefit from the likelihood that the homeowner's interest is real and that the potential project is correctly characterized. In addition, service providers give us geographic, job type and job size preferences, which enable us to match the service provider to a job that meets its preferences and expertise. Service providers can change their preferences at any time to reflect their changing needs and circumstances. Through our ImproveNetPro.com website, we have recently begun to communicate job leads in near real-time to the selected service providers. - COMPETITIVE DIFFERENTIATION. We believe service providers can differentiate themselves from their competitors by successfully completing our proprietary screening process and joining our network. We identify, contact and recruit service providers through many public and private sources. We have used Yellow Pages and licensing and trade association lists to identify, contact and recruit service providers into our network. We have not been able to screen approximately one-third of all service providers we have identified. Approximately one-third of the service providers who we have identified through lists or contacted through our various sources and roughly 50% of those we have screened have met our selection standards of professionalism and reliability. Currently, we have approximately 33,000 eligible service providers in our network who have indicated an interest in continuing to receive qualified job leads from us. - BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL EFFICIENCIES. Service providers who participate in our matching service pay only for job leads that they accept and for jobs that they win, allowing them to reduce their upfront marketing costs. New job leads from our matching service supplement the flow of work that contractors, architects and designers receive from their traditional sources, which allows them to plan and operate their businesses more efficiently. Furthermore, through our SmartLeads program, service providers in our network are able to gain efficient and timely access to the most recent product information available. In addition, service providers often gain access to special product discounts not available to their competitors. FOR SUPPLIERS OF HOME IMPROVEMENT PRODUCTS: - TARGETED ADVERTISING TO HOMEOWNERS. ImproveNet.com is designed to attract visitors who are focused on remodeling, repairing and maintaining their homes. We believe that this audience is a valuable target for suppliers of home improvement products and services. Banners, buttons and other forms of advertising allow these suppliers to target their message more efficiently and cost-effectively to a highly responsive and focused audience. Moreover, through our SmartLeads program, suppliers are able to reach service providers and homeowners engaged in home improvement projects through targeted messages. - TARGETED ADVERTISING TO SERVICE PROVIDERS. Through our SmartLeads program, we offer our suppliers the opportunity to run highly targeted promotions to our network of service providers based on detailed attributes including project type, cost, timing and location. This focused advertising offers suppliers an effective method of selling entire lines and specific products to highly interested service providers at the time of purchase. - CO-BRANDED WEB SITES. We offer suppliers the opportunity to place our content and services on their own Web sites or link to co-branded Web sites, without having to expend development time or resources. These co-branded Web sites allow suppliers to offer our content and services to their customers. In many of these arrangements, the suppliers share in the revenues from jobs referred through their site or the co-branded Web site. THE IMPROVENET STRATEGY Our strategy is to become America's home improvement resource on the Internet. The key elements of our strategy are: DELIVER A SATISFYING HOME IMPROVEMENT EXPERIENCE FOR HOMEOWNERS, SERVICE PROVIDERS AND SUPPLIERS The core of our strategy is to make it easy for homeowners, service providers and suppliers to work together on a home improvement project. We believe that achieving this goal will improve the perception of the home improvement industry in general and improve the level of professionalism and reliability among service providers, in particular. The independence of our matching service allows us to maintain a neutral role in the home improvement process. In addition, our focus on quick and easy access to information, improved project and market efficiencies and the creation of a central marketplace for home improvement products and services allows us to change the current approach and execution of a home improvement project. Through our online services, including our Web sites and SmartLeads program, and our offline support services, including our project advisors and professional services group, we seek to provide increased communication between all parties to a home improvement project and to create new efficiencies for the project itself. Access to this marketplace allows service providers in our network to increase their own business and financial efficiencies and differentiate themselves from their competitors. Similarly, this access allows suppliers to market their home improvement products and services within a cost effective advertising medium. We believe that the execution of our ongoing strategy requires us to: - expand and strengthen the pool of high quality information and content on our Web sites; - expand and strengthen our network of qualified and interested service providers; - improve our personal assistance to homeowners through our advisory services; - strengthen our communication with our network of service providers through ImproveNetPro.com and an enhanced, highly knowledgeable team of local service personnel; and - strengthen our relationships with suppliers through enhanced co-branded opportunities and highly targeted advertising products such as our SmartLeads program. INCREASE THE NUMBER OF JOBS SUBMITTED TO US AND THE PERCENTAGE OF JOBS WON BY SERVICE PROVIDERS IN OUR NETWORK We define our win rate as the number of jobs won by service providers in our network divided by the total number of jobs that we match. For 1999, our win rate was 8.9%. We intend to continue to increase our number of jobs and our job win rate by: - extending the breadth and depth of our content to create better quality jobs; - increasing participation by interested, responsive high-quality service providers; - building a local presence in major markets to work with our service providers; and - developing tracking systems and procedures to identify wins that are not reported to us by either the service provider or the homeowner. We have invested heavily in the development of content design tools and services and have refined our submission process to increase the quality of the homeowner experience and the quality and number of jobs submitted. We intend to use the service provider databases from suppliers of home improvement products to augment our service provider base. Our locally based professional services group recruits service providers, monitors their interest and participation and oversees their performance. We have embarked on an aggressive hiring program to expand our professional services group with a goal of increasing our local presence within the service provider community to 70 major population areas by the end of 2000. EXPAND EXISTING COMMERCIAL RELATIONSHIPS AND CREATE NEW ONES WITH SUPPLIERS OF HOME IMPROVEMENT PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AND RELATED HOME SERVICES We have recently entered into multi-year commercial contracts with Cendant, DuPont, General Electric Appliances, Microsoft and Owens Corning. We believe that these contracts provide these suppliers of home improvement products and services with a new advertising and marketing opportunity with the following benefits: - highly targeted, cost-efficient advertising to service providers and homeowners; - an immediate and enhanced Internet presence in the home improvement market; and - a focused Internet strategy including co-branding relationships and shared content. In turn, we realize the following benefits from these commercial relationships: - access to supplier's databases and co-branding opportunities; - assistance in attracting homeowners to ImproveNet.com; - increased number of job submissions, leads and wins; - assistance in building stronger relationships with our network of service providers; and - additional highly targeted, fully developed content for our Web sites. Based on the initial financial and strategic success of our existing multi-year commercial contracts, we are aggressively pursuing additional nationally recognized suppliers of various home improvement products and services. Specifically, we plan to target providers of related home services such as real estate brokers and homeowner finance and insurance companies and have entered into relationships with Cendant's CompleteHome and Microsoft's HomeAdvisor. CONTINUE TO BUILD THE IMPROVENET BRAND To enhance public awareness of our home improvement services, we are implementing a brand development program using mass market and targeted advertising, direct mail, word-of-mouth, promotions and public relations. Existing and future multi-year commercial contracts with recognized home improvement brands provide us with new opportunities to promote our brand through promotions and co-branding initiatives such as Powered by ImproveNet. In addition, these contracts provide us with the opportunity to use the consumer sales and marketing infrastructure, expertise and consumer information of these organizations which we could not otherwise access or afford in our normal course of business. We are also focused on systematically extending relationships with high traffic Web sites. We believe in focusing our advertising and promotions on homeowners during the home improvement planning cycle, the time when we believe homeowners and service providers are most receptive to brand association. SERVICES AND INFORMATION We offer several services including ImproveNet.com, our matching services, ImproveNetPro.com, SmartLeads and Powered by ImproveNet co-branded services. This space will contain two graphics. The first graphic depicts ImproveNet's relationship to its three principal constituents: homeowners, service providers and suppliers. The second graphic depicts the ImproveNet matching process from job submission to job completion. IMPROVENET.COM Our consumer Web site, ImproveNet.com, enables homeowners to browse, free of charge, our 30,000 pages of ideas and information for use in their home improvement projects and to use our project tools to help them better understand their home improvement project. Our design gallery on ImproveNet.com features color images of the work of leading architects and designers. For most designs, we provide images, comments from both the designer and our editors and a detailed list of products used in the design. Our product showcase on ImproveNet.com contains images of a full range of more than 5,000 distinct home improvement products and includes brands such as Armstrong, DuPont, General Electric Appliances, Owens Corning, Price-Pfister and Masco's Kraft Maid and Merrillat. We recently introduced our kitchen estimator, the first product in our project estimator service, which is designed to assist homeowners through the planning and budgeting stage of the home improvement process. This is an interactive application that allows homeowners to calculate prices for a project based on parameters such as physical dimensions, styles and the homeowner's zip code. Homeowners can register as members, without charge, which entitles them access to additional products and services. As part of the on-site registration process, we create a customized interface for each registered member, known as the personal project folder. The personal project folder permanently stores all information related to that homeowner's project and allows us to present custom-tailored information to that homeowner. Homeowners can store ideas they get from our design gallery, product showcase and product estimator, in addition to their own thoughts, as they plan and design their home improvement project. In addition, we offer premium services to homeowners for a fee. Our premium services include screening non-ImproveNet service providers and providing bid and contract assessment assistance. Our Web site gives homeowners access to a community of fellow Web site visitors and to service providers and industry professionals who can respond to home improvement questions. Visitors may read the more than 5,600 discussions currently on our message boards, and registered members may join in the discussions or post a new question. This feature gives homeowners who are now in the home improvement process a friendly environment in which to educate themselves further and to reduce their anxiety related to home improvement. Guiding homeowners through every stage of the home improvement process is central to our strategy of imparting information and personal assistance. Our project advisors are available to guide and advise the homeowner throughout the job. By personalizing both our Web site and our interactive communications to homeowners, we provide homeowners a user-friendly and highly productive environment in which to manage their projects. Furthermore, we believe that this personalization increases the likelihood that homeowners will return to us for all their home improvement needs. IMPROVENET'S MATCHING SERVICES We offer homeowners the opportunity to submit to us a home improvement job that we match with contractors, architects or designers who want to bid on the job. We currently match approximately half of the jobs submitted to us with interested service providers. Homeowners who are starting a home improvement project begin the process by clicking on our homepage links to ""Find a Contractor"" or ""Find a Designer"" and are then asked to complete a detailed project request form that specifies the type of job the homeowner desires. Based on the homeowner's project description, the homeowner's job request is then categorized by size as follows: - a large project, greater than $5,000 in value; - a small project, between $5,000 and $500 in value; and - a micro project, less than $500 in value. Once a fully qualified job has been submitted to us, we assign a project advisor to guide the homeowner through the entire home improvement process. We also notify the homeowner immediately that we will begin our search to match their project with potential service providers interested in bidding on the project. Our proprietary matching service uses the homeowner's project description to select the ImproveNet service providers in the homeowner's geographic area who do the type of work required. We deliver job leads to selected service providers by fax, email or by posting the leads on ImproveNetPro.com. Currently, we have approximately 33,000 eligible service providers in our network who have indicated an interest in continuing to receive qualified job leads from us. The interested service providers who first contact us get the opportunity to have their name submitted to the homeowner on the project. We currently allow up to four service providers to be matched on a large project, up to two service providers on a small project and one service provider on a micro project. We then forward the selected names on a first-come, first-served basis to the homeowner via e-mail, ideally within 72 hours of submission, a goal that we meet approximately 50% of the time. The service providers who we refer to the homeowner pay us a fee for the job lead. Service providers contact the homeowner directly by telephone to discuss the job in detail, ideally within 72 hours of our e-mail. Once the homeowner and service provider have been matched, the service provider is able to bid on the project at any time after meeting with the homeowner. If a job does not receive a contact from an interested service provider within approximately one week of submission, the project advisor works on behalf of the homeowner to locate available and interested service providers. The project advisor sends a series of messages to the homeowner that provide project management advice, offer premium services and market supplier product offerings. The homeowner is free to contact his or her project advisor as many times as needed by e-mail or by telephone. Following the completion of the project, we solicit a quality-assurance survey to determine the outcome of the matching process and the level of homeowner satisfaction. We invoice service providers for a win fee based on a predetermined percentage of the job's value for every job they win through our matching service. These win fees are based on a non-negotiable, fixed-fee schedule based on estimated job size, as follows: ESTIMATED JOB SIZE FEE MAXIMUM Less than $5,000.......................................... 10% of job size $250 $5,000 - $10,000.......................................... 5% of job size $300 $10,000 - $35,000......................................... 3% of job size $700 Greater than $35,000...................................... 2% of job size $995 We ask our service providers not to charge the win fee in the bid quote to the homeowner. We currently collect our win fees directly from service providers once the service provider or the homeowner informs us that the homeowner has hired a service provider through our matching service. IMPROVENETPRO.COM Our recently introduced commercial Web site, ImproveNetPro.com, provides new or enhanced services to our service providers. ImproveNetPro.com allows us to communicate in near real-time with participating service providers who are online. ImproveNetPro.com provides our contractors, architects and designers with immediate access to new job postings. Once a service provider enters the password-protected section of ImproveNetPro.com, he or she is immediately presented with the status of new jobs available to the service provider that match their location, preferences and expertise. We believe that ImproveNetPro.com will assist us to enhance the loyalty of our contractors, architects and designers. SMARTLEADS In the course of helping homeowners manage home improvement projects, we obtain timely and specific information from them regarding the nature of their home improvement projects. With SmartLeads, we offer our suppliers of home improvement products the opportunity to send direct e-mail messages about their products to service providers and homeowners who are making purchasing decisions during the home improvement process. Currently, our service providers cannot opt out of the SmartLeads program, while homeowners may request that they not be included in the SmartLeads program. We charge suppliers a fee for each message sent. We believe this is a targeted and cost-effective means for suppliers to reach homeowners and service providers near the time of purchase. POWERED BY IMPROVENET AND FIND A CONTRACTOR We provide a customized product superimposing ImproveNet.com content including our matching services on third-party Web sites so that the content looks like the third party's own content but is Powered by ImproveNet. This customized product allows our logo and our products and services to be placed across a broad spectrum of third-party Web sites related to home improvement, from online versions of traditional media properties to Web sites related to manufacturing, finance, real estate and local and regional guides. If a customer of these third parties uses our matching services, we pay the supplier a portion of any service revenue from that match. We also advertise on third party Web sites through our Find a Contractor service. We place a ""Find a Contractor"" banner or button on third party Web sites that links the user to ImproveNet.com. We pay these third parties either a flat fee or on a per referral basis. Since many of the third-party Web sites that use Powered by ImproveNet and Find a Contractor are related to the home improvement industry, we believe these programs will deliver more qualified traffic to our Web site. We also believe that Web sites that are related to the home improvement industry and will participate in these programs will benefit from the access to our matching services.

Our ratings and reviews, which are available only to our members, help our members to find the best provider for their local service needs. We have more than 1,000,000 paid memberships. We allow local service providers who are highly rated by our members to advertise discounts and other promotions to our members. We help consumers purchase “high cost of failure” services in an extremely fragmented local marketplace. These services, which include home remodeling, plumbing, roof repair, health care and automobile repair, are typically expensive and carry a high cost to the consumer if performed poorly. Our ratings are based exclusively on reviews from our members and we accept no anonymous reviews. As a result, we believe our reviews are a trusted resource for consumers to find high quality local service providers. We also help local service providers find quality customers and differentiate themselves in a competitive marketplace. Our members represent an attractive, targeted group of consumers for service providers. Our typical member is between the ages of 35 and 64, is married, owns a home, is college educated and has an annual household income of at least $100,000, based on information derived and interpreted by us as a result of our own analysis from general demographic data provided by Nielsen. In 2010, our members averaged 11.4 unique searches per member for local service providers and 37% of our members wrote a review on at least one service provider. The value proposition we offer to both consumers and local service providers strengthens our position as a trusted resource and allows us to derive revenue from both members and service providers. As more members contribute reviews to our service, we increase the breadth and depth of content offered to members, attracting more members and enhancing the value of our service to reputable local service providers, for whom our members constitute a large pool of qualified customers for their services. As of September 30, 2011, we offered our service to paying members in 175 local markets in the United States. From December 31, 2008 to date, we grew from approximately 333,000 to more than 1,000,000 paid memberships, representing a compound annual growth rate of more than 47.5%. Our membership growth has been driven largely by our national advertising strategy, which resulted in our marketing expense of $30.2 million and $48.0 million in 2010 and the nine months ended September 30, 2011, respectively. We continue to scale our investment in advertising to grow our membership base. In 2010 and the nine months ended September 30, 2011, our revenue was $59.0 million and $62.6 million, respectively. In the same periods, our net loss was $27.2 million and $43.2 million. We have incurred net losses since inception and had an accumulated deficit of $160.6 million as of September 30, 2011. ------ We were organized in the State of Indiana in April 1995 as Brownstone Publishing, LLC.

We believe that our social business software unleashes creativity, drives innovation and improves productivity by increasing engagement within the enterprise, as well as with customers and partners. We believe that just as consumer social technologies are changing the way we live, social business software is transforming the way we work. We provide a social business software platform that we believe improves business results by enabling a more productive and effective workforce through enhanced communication and collaboration both inside and outside the enterprise. We believe our platform is intuitive, easy to use, flexible and scalable, and can be provided as a public cloud service or as a private cloud solution. We are focused on unlocking the power of the enterprise social graph — the extended social network of an enterprise, encompassing relationships among its employees, customers and partners, as well as their interactions with people and content. Organizations deploy our platform to improve strategic decision making and employee productivity, enhance revenue opportunities, lower operational costs and increase customer retention. Our comprehensive Jive Engage Platform enables collaboration across two principal communities: employees within the enterprise and customers and partners outside the enterprise. Internally, the Jive Engage Platform is used as a communications tool and collaborative workspace that supports and enhances knowledge sharing, facilitates communication within and across organizational boundaries, and enables individuals to work together to achieve common business goals. Externally, customers and partners of the enterprise use our platform to connect socially with one another, as well as with the enterprise, in a structured online community that allows users to ask questions, post answers and communicate about a product or particular issue. Our solution also taps into the social web by integrating relevant content and connections across the social networking landscape, enabling enterprises to improve their interactions with customers, leverage feedback to deliver improved products and services, and respond more quickly to market opportunities. Our social business software platform has been successfully deployed in complex environments with tens of thousands of employees internally and millions of users externally. We provide our platform both as a public cloud service and as a private cloud solution that integrates with application services from the public cloud. Our deployment model enables access through web browsers, desktop applications and mobile devices. Our platform integrates with and leverages legacy, on-premise and hosted enterprise systems such as email, content management, customer relationship management, marketing automation, product development, eCommerce, instant messaging and other related applications. We also recently introduced the Jive Apps Market, which enables customers and third parties to develop applications that leverage our platform and utilize the enterprise social graph. Our social business software has been recognized as a leading platform by industry analysts. Gartner, Inc., or Gartner, has recognized us as a market leader in three distinct reports: the “ Magic Quadrant for Social Software for the Workspace ,” the “ Magic Quadrant for Externally Facing Social Software ” and the “ Magic Quadrant for Social Customer Relationship Management .”* Forrester lists us as a leader in two reports: “The Forrester Wave TM : Enterprise Social Platforms, Q3 2011” and “The Forrester Wave TM : Community Platforms, Q4 2010.”* We sell our platform primarily through a direct sales force both domestically and internationally. As of September 30, 2011, we had 657 enterprise Jive Engage Platform customers with over 17 million users within these customers and their communities. Some of our top 10 customers by annual contract value for the year ended December 31, 2010 and nine months ended September 30, 2011 include Hewlett-Packard Company, SAP AG, T-Mobile and UBS AG. ----- We were incorporated in the state of Delaware in February 2001.

We make it easy, convenient and cost effective for individuals to find and gain access to the mobile Internet through high-speed, high-bandwidth Wi-Fi networks globally.

With the proliferation of smartphones, laptops, tablet computers and other mobile devices, individuals increasingly demand Internet access to facilitate their use, while on-the-go, of data-intensive applications, such as streaming media, online games, social networking and video calling. We believe this demand creates a significant market opportunity that we are uniquely positioned to capture. We have direct customer relationships with over 1.3 million users who have purchased our mobile Internet services in the past 12 months. We also provide solutions to our partners, which include telecom operators, cable companies, technology companies, enterprise software and services companies, and communications companies, allowing their millions of users to connect to the mobile Internet through Wi-Fi hotspots in our network. Our primary source of revenue is from individuals who purchase month-to-month subscription plans, which automatically renew, or hotspot specific, single-use access to our network. Our partners pay us usage-based network access and software licensing fees to allow their customers access to our network. We also generate revenue from telecom operators that pay us build-out fees and access fees so that their cellular customers may use our distributed antenna system, or DAS, at locations where we manage and operate the Wi-Fi network.
